"<p>I'm learning VBA as a means to speed up some processes at my work. I have to send rooming lists to properties in PDF format generated form excel. I have the following code that works great, but I get an error message whenever one of the worksheets is hidden. I have to hide sheets often as properties change from trip to trip.</p>

<p>I want to PDF the Worksheets from the 4th sheet to the sheetname ""Post"". Whenever I hide a sheet in between these I get the following error message ""Run-time error '5': Invalid procedure call or argument""</p>

<p>Here's the code: </p>

<pre><code>Sub SaveAllPDF()
Dim I As Integer
Dim Fname As String
Dim TabCount As Long


TabCount = Sheets(""Post"").Index

' Begin the loop.

For I = 4 To TabCount
Sheets(I).Activate

End With
Next I
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone have any ideas how to remedy this problem so the 'For I = 4 to TabCount' ignores any hidden tabs? Any help would be MUCH appreciated, I've been trying to tackle this problem for a long time and do not have much VBA knowledge. </p>
","<p>With your current loop, this is best avoided by simply checking that the WorkSheet is visible before trying to export.  The Visible property contains this info.  The value should be xlSheetVisible if the sheet is visible.</p>

"<p>Chart = xy Scatter</p>

<p>I have a chart on which I have set a Horizontal Axis Crosses-Axis value = 200. And that chart looks as follows:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ISljx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now I wish to reverse the order of the y-axis labels. But when I check ""Values in reverse order"" the x-axis labels jump above the x-axis line as follows:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UbxpI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I'd like the x-axis labels to be bellow the x-axis line. I have been trying various VBA code and just various excel options. Such as:</p>

<p>.TickLabels.Offset (this offsets the x-axis labels further away from the x-axis, will not accept negative numbers)</p>

<p>I wanted to add a large MarginTop value to the x-axis labels, but I was unable to figure out the VBA code and the option is greyed out in Excel.</p>

<p>Any possible thoughts or solutions would be very much appreciated.</p>
","<p>If you can live with the x-axis being at the bottom of the chart, you can get the labels back ""under"" the axis by changing the TickLabelPosition to be equal to xlTickLabelPositionHigh.  It looks better if you also cross the y-axis at the ""Maximum axis value"".  This puts the axis formatting at the bottom (really the maximum value) with the labels.</p>

<p>You can get all these settings from the normal menus.  If you need VBA to do this, here is a starting point:</p>

<pre><code>Sub reverseAxisAndLabelAtBottom()

    Dim cht As Chart
    Dim x_axis As Axis
    Dim y_axis As Axis

    'using the ActiveChart... assumes it is selected

    Set cht = ActiveChart
    Set x_axis = cht.Axes(xlCategory)
    Set y_axis = cht.Axes(xlValue)

    y_axis.ReversePlotOrder = True
    x_axis.TickLabelPosition = xlTickLabelPositionHigh
    y_axis.Crosses = xlAxisCrossesMaximum


End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried to do this by adding a dummy series and putting reversed y-axis on the secondary axis.  This gets the labels right, but then the y-axis is forced over to the far right.  I would not call that an ""ideal"" way of doing it.</p>

"<p>I am trying to use a macro to delete data that follows after a certain word/phrase in excel.</p>

<p>The problem is the cell position can vary depending on how many lines there are in the spreadsheet after the report has been run/exported. I need a solution, if possible, to target a certain phrase (using the find function i presume) and delete 30 cells down from that wherever the text may be (no cet cell).</p>

<p>Is this possible?</p>
","<p>This is possible, but the specifics of what you want are not the clearest.  Here is some code that will get you started.  It looks for a given phrase in all of the cells on the sheet.  If it finds it, it adds the 30 cells below that one into a group that is slated for deletion.  Once it searches all the cells, it deletes the groups that were collected.</p>

<p>Since we are iterating through the collection that we want to delete from, I collect the cells to delete (using Union) and delete them after the loop closes.</p>

<p>This may not be the fastest code since it searches all cells in the UsedRange, but it should work for most uses.</p>

"<p>I would like to chart the states of a machine over a period of time. For example it may be ""running"" for 2 hours and then ""stopped"" for 1 hour, and there may be several times each state occurs. Using a stacked bar chart I'd like to display the state and the amount of time it stays in the state.
I'm finding that excel is assigning a new color and legend entry to each new state instance even if that state has already occurred.<br>
How can I make same-named states within a chart have the same color (e.g. every time ""running"" is displayed it has the same color and a single legend entry)? Thanks</p>
","<p>The state name is stored as the Series Name.  There is a series for each stack in the Chart.  It is possible to iterate through series and style them based on the Series Name.  It is also possible to remove entries from the Legend using the LegendEntries object.</p>

<p>Combining these into a loop, you can update the series color if it matches a title and then remove the item from the Legend if it is not one of the first two Series.  This assumes that ""running"" and ""stopped"" alternate at the start and are the entries to keep in the Legend.  If this is not the case, you could do more logic to spot the entries to keep.</p>

<p>Now I want background color for column 'complaint' according to cell value, like if cell value RED I want that background color also RED etc.. in VBA code.</p>
","<p>Changing the background color of a cell is simple.  Determining what color to change it to is the key step here.  If you know that those 4 colors are the only options, I would just pound out the cases and set the colors.  If you find this growing to more colors, you may want to define them in a Dictionary and do a lookup instead of the SELECT-CASE construction.</p>

<p>This simple code would work with your example.  You will want to define the Range better (probably not ""D2:D5"") based on your real application and tweak the colors.</p>

<pre><code>Sub ColorWithText()

    Dim cell As Range

"<p>I have a list of stock prices pulled from Google finance and placed in different sheets in my Excel. I'm wondering, Can I refresh Excel sheet every SECOND (not minute) according to the Google finance stock price?</p>
","<p>This can be done without having a macro constantly running.  It relies on the <strong>Application.OnTime</strong> method which allows an action to be scheduled out in the future. I have used this approach to force Excel to refresh data from external sources.</p>

<p>The code below is based nearly exclusively on the code at this link: <a href=""http://www.cpearson.com/excel/ontime.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cpearson.com/excel/ontime.aspx</a></p>

<p>The reference for Application.OnTime is at: <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff196165.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff196165.aspx</a></p>

<pre><code>Dim RunWhen As Date

Sub StartTimer()
    Dim secondsBetween As Integer
    secondsBetween = 1

    RunWhen = Now + TimeSerial(0, 0, secondsBetween)
    Application.OnTime EarliestTime:=RunWhen, Procedure:=""CodeToRun"", Schedule:=True
End Sub

Sub StopTimer()
    On Error Resume Next
    Application.OnTime EarliestTime:=RunWhen, Procedure:=""CodeToRun"", Schedule:=False

    'you can add other code here to determine when to start
    StartTimer

    [A1] = WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(0, 100)


    'be sure to call the start again if you want it to repeat
    StartTimer

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>In this code, the StartTimer and StopTimer calls are used to manage the Timers.  The EntryPoint code gets things started and CodeToRun includes the actual code to run.  Note that to make it repeat, you call StartTimer within CodeToRun.  This allows it to loop.  You can stop the loop by calling the StopTimer or simply not calling StartTimer again.  This can be done with some logic in CodeToRun.</p>

"<p>I have a column of cells (Range A2:A10) which contain names of students. For each student, I have a chart titled after their name which track their performances in another sheet. I would like to change the chart background to light red colour if their names appear in the column of cells. </p>
","<p>This is a fairly straight forward combination of ideas.  You need to iterate through the charts, check the title against a list, and change the background color.  The code below is an example to show the idea.</p>

<p>When iterating through Charts on a sheet, you start with the ChartObjects method.  The ChartObject contains a reference to the actual Chart where you can get the Title and change the background.  Note that checking the Title of a Chart without one will throw an error, so I start with a check to Chart.HasTitle.</p>

<p>I am using Application.Match to check if the range contains the title.  This will return an error if it is not found, so I am checking for that error.</p>

<p>Finally, if the match exists, you change the background of the Chart through a lengthy list of properties.  If you want to change a different part of the chart, record a macro to find the right property.</p>

<pre><code>Sub ColorBasedOnTitle()

    Dim chtObj As ChartObject
    Dim sht As Worksheet
    Dim rng_students As Range

    'assume active sheet, change if not
    Set sht = ActiveSheet

    'need to set a reference to the list of names... named range is probably prefered here
    Set rng_students = sht.Range(""B3:B6"")

    'loop through all charts on sheet
    For Each chtObj In sht.ChartObjects

        'if chart has title, check its value
        Dim title As String
        If chtObj.Chart.HasTitle Then
            title = chtObj.Chart.ChartTitle.Text

            'use Match to see if title is in list of names
            Dim search As Variant
            search = Application.Match(title, rng_students, 0)

            'see if student is in list, change background if so

","<p>I tested this out on some dummy examples and it worked well.  The idea is to loop through the cells in your range of interest and group them if the level is greater in rows below the current cell.  It works its way down which builds the hierarchy.  You can then use the grouping buttons to show different levels.</p>

<p>This code works if the level column has no breaks (since I am using Range.End to get the last cell).</p>

    'clear previous outline

","<p>One option when deleting cells is to use the UNION-DELETE pattern.  This saves the deletion step until after the logic is determined and does it all at once.

","<p>Your application is going to have a large number of specific details which are difficult to address without the specifics.  To get started, here is some very simple code to get the Date from a drop-down in Excel from Word.</p>

<p>Note to work with Word, you need to create a reference to ""Microsoft Word 15.0 Object Library"" on the Excel side.  Tools -> References in the VBA Editor.</p>

<p>When working across applications, it can help to write the VBA in Word and then move it over to Excel once you have the properties you want.</p>

<p>This VBA for the Excel side of the equation:</p>

    Set file = wrd.Documents.Open(""test.docx"")

    Range(""A1"") = file.ContentControls(1).Range.Text

    file.Close
    wrd.Quit

End Sub

<p>My Word file includes a single ContentControl.  Not sure how you address the ones you want (trial and error?).</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>Your approach for outputting the data is only referencing a single cell.  You use <code>.Cells(1,icol)</code> which will only reference a single cell (in row 1, and a single column).</p>

<p>In order to output the data to a larger range, you need to reference a larger range.  The easiest way to do this is probably via <code>Resize()</code> using the size of the RefEdit range.</p>

<p>I believe this will work for you.  I changed the last line to include a call to <code>Resize</code>.</p>

"<p>I an writing a UDF that needs to accept both Arrays and Ranges.</p>

<p>Usually declaring parameter as variant would work but a Range is an object so this no longer applies. That being said bellow I pasted code that only works when passing an array.<br>
Here is theorethical example, based on <code>SUM</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Function TSUM(numbers() As Variant) As Variant
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 1 To UBound(numbers, 1)
        TSUM = TSUM + numbers(i)
    Next i
End Function
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>=TSUM({1,1})   Returns 2<br>
  =TSUM(A1:B1)   Returns #VALUE!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how can I fix above example to accept Ranges as well?</p>
","<p>If you are content to sum the array/range item by item, I would just change to using a For Each loop that works well for either Ranges or Arrays.</p>

<p>Here is that version</p>

<pre><code>Public Function TSUM(numbers As Variant) As Variant
    Dim i As Variant

    For Each i In numbers
        TSUM = TSUM + i
    Next i
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>If you generally want to work a function  based on the type of the argument, you can use <code>TypeName()</code> and switching logic.  Here is you function with that approach.  I called it TSUM2 for uniqueness.</p>

<pre><code>Public Function TSUM2(numbers As Variant) As Variant
    Dim i As Integer

    If TypeName(numbers) = ""Range"" Then
        TSUM2 = Application.WorksheetFunction.Sum(numbers)
    Else
        For i = 1 To UBound(numbers, 1)
            TSUM2 = TSUM2 + numbers(i)
        Next i
    End If
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Note in both examples, I removed the parentheses from the numbers parameters (was <code>numbers() as Variant</code> before).  This allows it to accept Range inputs.</p>

<p>If you take the second approach, be sure to debug and verify the TypeNames that could come through.</p>

"<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I have a workbook with 3 sheets, each entitled ""HeatNumbers"", ""HeatSheetTemplate"", and ""Heat vs Order"".  The Heat vs Order sheet has a number of new rows of data added to it daily, so the number of rows is always changing.  Here is a picture of the column headings and some data:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nkyGJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>What I am looking for:</strong></p>

<p>On the HeatNumbers sheet, I have a button that executes some VBA code.  Here is a pic of that sheet:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ur7t.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here is what I need to happen:  A user will enter data into the black box in column J on a number of rows.  Each line could contain an FO#.  When the button is clicked, I need to filter all of the data on the Heat vs Order sheet above by any FO# in that black box region, copy that resultset over to the HeatNumbers sheet, beginning in row 2 col A, and then remove the filter from the Heat vs Order sheet.</p>

<p><strong>What I have tried:</strong></p>

<p>The only way I have been able to achieve this is by having the user manually filter the data on the Heat vs. Order sheet and copy and pasting the result to the HeatNumbers tab.  This is cumbersome and prone to error, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Here is the code that was generated using the macro recorder:</p>

<pre><code>Sub Filter_FO()
'
' Filter_FO Macro
'
    Range(""A1:H20000"").AdvancedFilter Action:=xlFilterInPlace, CriteriaRange:= Sheets(""HeatNumbers"").Range(""J4:J22""), Unique:=False
    ActiveWindow.SmallScroll Down:=-15
    Range(""A4:H300"").Select
    Selection.Copy
    Sheets(""HeatNumbers"").Select
    ActiveWindow.SmallScroll Down:=-15
    Range(""A2:H300"").Select
    ActiveSheet.Paste
End Sub
</code></pre>
","<p>In order to get the filter to work correctly, you need to use a <code>CriteriaRange</code> that only includes cells with values in them.  The easiest way to do this is using the <code>.End(xlDown)</code> function.  That works functions in the same way as CTRL+DOWN arrow and will select the last cell in that column of data so long as there are no blanks in between.</p>

<p>The second piece is to possibly improve the range of the data being filtered.  Right now you are selecting a large area and hoping it includes the data you want.  If your code works now, you can leave it.  Improvements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using just the column letters so that the whole columns are filtered.  This works if the headers stay in row 1.  This is a little slow though.</li>
<li>If the data is a large block, you can use <code>.End(xlUp)</code> to find the last row and use that.  This is included below.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then the final piece is selecting the right range of data to copy.  I just took the data range and selected visible cells using <code>.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)</code>.</p>

<p>In order for the copy to work cleanly, I clear out columns <code>A:H</code> on <code>HeatNumbers</code> to prevent any old data from sitting around.  When I paste the data back over, I include the headers.  This is the only real difference from your macro.</p>

<pre><code>Sub FilterDataAndClearAndCopy()

    'get references to sheets

","<p>If you want an alternative to using VBA to build the interface, I have previously deployed Excel add-ins (XLAM files) using some variety of Ribbon XML.

","<p>As @Greg mentioned, the <code>.Select</code> is not needed.  Once that is removed though, you will have a new problem where the two ranges are not the same size.  <code>Range(""A1"")</code> is only 1 cell while the other range will be at least 11.  Your current VBA will only overwrite the values in the Range called for, which is <code>A1</code> here.</p>

","<p>There appears to be nothing wrong with your code.  You are seeing the result of what happens when you use the <code>WorksheetFunction</code> version of functions and no result is returned.  Specifically, they throw an error and interrupt execution of the VBA.  In this case, if you tried the same formula in the workbook instead of in VBA, you would get some form of error (<code>#N/A</code> or <code>#VALUE!</code> possibly).</p>

<p>If you want to prevent this from happening, the easiest thing to do is to change to using <code>Application.VLookup</code> instead of <code>Application.WorksheetFunction.VLookup</code>.  Although there is no Intellisense to help with this function it behaves the same as the other except for error handling.  If the non-<code>WorksheetFunction</code> version of a function has an error, it will return the error instead of throwing it.  This allows you to check for an error and then carry on with your code.</p>

<p>If you think you should be finding a value with <code>VLOOKUP</code> here then you can start checking for mismatches between text/numbers and other things like that.  I would check with formulas and not in VBA though.</p>

<p><br><br><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> <strong>how to achieve this?</strong></p>

<p><br>Actually in my original data, the first three columns have data every 88 rows starting from row 3 and the column D should get merged every four rows. <br></p>
","<p>Your code does not distinguish between the different columns in any way.  If you know how many rows to merge you can simply search for cells and then do the merge based on column number.  Here is one such approach which uses a pair of arrays to track how many rows to merge and then what formatting to apply.</p>

<p>You will need to change the row counts in the array definition.  Sounds like you want (87,87,87,3) based on your edit.  I did (11,11,11,3) to match your example though.  This is the real fix to your code; it uses the <code>Column</code> number to determine how many rows to merge.</p>

"<p>I'm not sure this is possible but thought this was the best place to ask.</p>

<p>Is it posible to get the position of a series value on a graph in excel?</p>

<p>For example,  if I have a line graph in excel that has time along the x axis, is it possible to (using VBA) get the position of a specific point on that axis.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is have a vertical line that is can be positioned based on a date entered by the user.</p>

<p>like this</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/n1G6U.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Where the green line could be positioned by entering in a date (rather than just being manually moved)  (or also it could be set to automatically move to the current date etc).</p>

<p>I was then thinking that if the position is on the graph is queryable, then I can just access the line object and move it to any position I wanted through VBA.</p>

<p>Any Ideas?  or is this just not possible? </p>
","<p>The ""cleanest"" way to do this is to add the line to the chart as a new series.  In that way, Excel handles all of the positioning and your work is simplified.  To get a vertical line on a chart, there are a number of options.  I prefer this route:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a small 2x2 area with two dates and two values</li>
<li>Add in the date or x-axis value you want the line at (<code>E3</code> in image).  You can use <code>=TODAY()</code> here or some manually entered value.</li>
<li>Set the second x-axis value equal to the first</li>
<li>Use <code>MAX</code> and <code>MIN</code> on the data to get the values for each date.  You can also use 0 and 1 and a secondary axis, but I think <code>MAX/MIN</code> is easier.</li>
<li>Add the data to the chart and format as a marker with straight line.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Formulas</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>E3</code>: <code>=TODAY()</code></li>
<li><code>E4</code>: <code>=E3</code></li>
<li><code>F3</code>: <code>=MIN(C3:C27)</code></li>
<li><code>F4</code>: <code>=MAX(C3:C27)</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result and chart data series for vertical line</strong></p>

"<p>I have an Excel sheet, and column <code>A</code> has a list of product names. Most of the products have multiple variations, such as:</p>

<pre><code>A1: LDP2-sm
A2: LDP2-med
A3: LDP2-lg
A4: LDP3-sm
A5: LDP3-med
A6: LDP3-lg
A7: LDP3-xlg
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>LDP2</code> is 1 product with 3 variations and <code>LDP3</code> is 1 product with 4 variations</p>

<p>How do I loop through this list and find the start of a new variation? In the above example, I'd want to find <code>A1</code> and <code>A4</code>. Then, I want to insert a row above each.</p>

<p>Here is the code I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>Dim rw As Long
Dim lr As Long
Dim cnt As Long
lr = 500
rw = 2
cnt = 1
Do
    If Range(""A"" &amp; cnt).Value = *FIRST VARIATION OF A NEW PRODUCT*
        Rows(rw).Insert Shift:=xlDown
        cnt = cnt + 1
    Else
        cnt = cnt + 1
    End If
    rw = rw + 1
Loop While rw &lt;&gt; lr
</code></pre>

<p>What code do I need for <em>FIRST VARIATION OF A NEW PRODUCT</em>?</p>

<p>It needs to determine if the value of the cell starts with a different prefix than the cell above it.</p>

<p>I won't know what the product name starts with or how many variations the product has, but I do know that the first portion of the product name will change. I.e. <code>LDP2</code>, <code>LDP3</code>, <code>LDP4</code>, etc.</p>
","<p><code>Split</code> is the function you are looking for if you will always have a single <code>-</code> in the name.  It will give you each part of the name and you can then compare to the previous row.</p>

<p>Here is code that works for your example.</p>

<pre><code>Sub SplitProductName()

    Dim rng_cell As Range
    Dim str_prev As String

    For Each rng_cell In Range(Range(""A1""), Range(""A1"").End(xlDown))

        Dim parts As Variant

        parts = Split(rng_cell, ""-"")

        'check that it is different
        If parts(0) &lt;&gt; str_prev Then
            rng_cell.EntireRow.Insert xlUp
        End If

        'assign previous for next row
        str_prev = parts(0)

    Next rng_cell

"<p>I have an Excel spreadsheet that has add-in functions that compute on data given in a fixed range. All the worksheets work properly with pressing of F9 or Shift-F9 keys.</p>

<p>I am writing a for loop with VBA. It copies a range from one worksheet which contains all the data to another worksheet. Then calculates manually one worksheet at a time, with pauses, and even compute twice so as to ensure the execution of each worksheet. If I manually step through the VBA code line by line in the debug mode through the whole for loops, everything works. However, if I press F5 and run the whole VBA for loop at full speed. The code produces the same result for many (not all) of the consecutive iterations of the for loop, while I know the results should all be different. My guess is that the workseets become stale and are not replaced with new data.</p>

","<p>Consider the use of <code>Application.CalculateFullRebuild</code> instead of multiple calls to <code>Calculate</code> for each sheet.  It will force a recalc of everything and rebuild dependencies (as the name implies).</p>

<p>Depending on how formulas are related between sheets, you might not be triggering the right order of calculations processing each sheet one at a time.  The full rebuild approach is the ""nuclear option"" for refreshing a spreadsheet.  Specifically, calling <code>sht.Cells.Dirty</code> and then <code>sht.Calculate</code> may only force a refresh of the current sheet without consideration for changes on other sheets.</p>

","<p>Use <code>Application.VLookup</code> instead of <code>Application.WorksheetFunction.VLookup</code>.  The latter throws an application error when the query is not found.

<p>See below for answer.  If you haven't used forms before (like myself), the code that begins with ""Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()"" should NOT be inserted in the same module.  Go to Insert > Userform, then drag two command buttons onto the UI box, and another ""Userform code"" window should appear.  That new window is where the ""Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()"" code should go.</p>

<p>I am trying to create a template to rearrange a data set that is exported in a horrible format.  I have posted a link to a Google Doc that has an example of the data in its current format followed by how I need it to be formatted. Currently, all data for a given person is in a single row, and the ID # is repeated before each record, as shown. Each record consists of 12 columns, and this is repeated 31 times across a row, totaling 372 cells per row. There are 838 rows (or 837 without the headers).  I need either a set of formulas or a macro that will separate a single row of data (the 372 cells) into 31 rows of 12 columns for an entire spreadsheet. I have been able to accomplish this only with a single row (using the <code>offset</code> function and then again using <code>index</code>), but I am struggling to find a way to make it apply to every row on a worksheet. Once that first row is done, the formula goes no further. Ideally, the rearranged data will appear on a <strong>new</strong> worksheet. I can't just manually separate the rows and filter them by ID #, because then I would have to redo that every time I rerun the report. Please let me know if I can give any further clarification!</p>
","<p>Here is a formula based solution.  It assumes that you can create a new sheet to reform the data.  Based on your description, sounds like this is what you want anyways.  I have dummied down the example to have 4 categories and 3 repeats per row. Change the 4 and 3 below to match your 12 and 31.  (Harder to take a snapshot like that!)</p>

<p><strong>Picture of data and results.</strong></p>

<p>Data.  You can pretend that my column header ""A"" is your ""ID"".</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3MbdC.png"" alt=""data""></p>

<p>Results.  It repeats the headers for simplicity.  You can delete those out at the end.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzThk.png"" alt=""results""></p>

<p><strong>Formula</strong> in <code>A1</code> on <code>Sheet2</code> and copied over 4 columns and down as many rows as needed.</p>

<pre><code>=INDEX(Sheet1!$A$1:$L$7,INT((ROW()-1)/3)+1,MOD(ROW()-1,3)*4+COLUMN())
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>INDEX</code> is used to return a given cell from the array of the entire data</li>
<li><code>INDEX</code> needs a row and column to retrieve so I used integer division to determine the row.  We know that a given row in the results needs to be repeated for as many repeats of the headers as there are.  In this case 3.  The <code>ROW()</code> refers to the row in the results, and the <code>-1</code> is to ensure that it starts at <code>0</code> instead of <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>The column for <code>INDEX</code> comes from the same idea.  For a given row, it needs to get a column that is the current column ""pushed"" over by the repeating row.  The <code>MOD</code> here ensures that the column numbers repeat in a small range even though the row is becoming a large number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, this formula really relies on the results starting in <code>A1</code> on a fresh sheet.  You can do it differently, but the formulas will become (even more of) a mess.</p>

<p>instead (as proposed in the link above), then it works just fine. Except for the fact that the array is not being recgonised anymore, i.e. <em>MsgBox ""Single Value: ""</em> is called instead of <em>MsgBox ""Array:""</em>.</p>

<p>So my question is: How can I evaluate long formulas (which return arrays) using VBA?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Let me stress that I need this to work when I only select the <strong>one cell</strong> that conains the formula (not a region or several cells). And I have not entered it as an array formula (i.e. no curly brackets):
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FDvrh.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Let me answer the why: my current work requires me to have a long list of such large formulas in a spreadsheet. And since they are organised in a list every such formula can only take up one cell. In almost all cases the formulas return single values (and hence one cell is sufficient to store/display the output). However, when there is an internal error in evaluating the formula, the formula returns an error message. These error messages are usually quite long and are therefore returned as an array of varying size (depending on how long the error message is). So my goal was to write a VBA function that would first obtain and then output the full error message for a given selected entry from the list.</p>
","<p>I believe that <code>Application.Evaluate</code> will return a result that matches the size of the input address.  I suspect that your <code>Selection</code> is a single cell so it is returning a single value.</p>

<p>If instead you call it with <code>Selection.CurrentArray.Address</code> you will get an answer that is the same size as the correct array.</p>

<p><strong>Picture of VBA and Excel</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1h2Rj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Code to test with</strong></p>

<pre><code>Public Function Test() As Variant

    Test = Array(1, 2)


End Function

Sub t()

    Dim a As Variant

    a = Application.Evaluate(Selection.CurrentArray.Address)

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>, based on comments here is a way evaluate this off sheet by creating a new sheet.  I am using a cut/paste approach to ensure the formulas all work the same.  This probably works better if cells don't reference the cut one.  It will technically not break any other cells though since I am using cut/paste.</p>

<p>In the code below, I had an array formula in cell <code>J2</code> it referenced several other cells.  It is expanded to have 3 rows and then the <code>Evaluate</code> call is made.  That returns an array like you want.  It then shrinks it down to one cell and moves it back.</p>

<p>I have tested this for a simple example.  I have no idea if it works for the application you have in mind.</p>

ColumnLetter finds the column letter of the new column.</p>

<p>Here's what the full code does (some of which isn't included here).</p>

<p>I have a ""template"" column which is copied to a new column.  The info is updated in the new column and then towards the end of the programme, this hyperlink subroutine is run.</p>

<p>It works very well, but replacing the letter of the template column within the hyperlink address to the new column.</p>

<p>However once it has run, the hyperlinks in the template column have also changed.</p>

<p>I have stopped the code before the hyperlink subroutine is run and the hyperlinks are as expected and have not been changed - ie both columns match the links from the template column.  Therefore I am confident this is the problem code (which makes sense).</p>

<p>I have tried a number of iterations of selecting the new column, to no avail, it always changes the hyperlinks in both columns.</p>

<p>I have even manually run through the code using F8, checking the column number and row number of each hyperlink it seems to be updating and it doesn't even change to the template column!</p>

<p>I'm at a loss.  Please help.</p>
","<p>I believe <code>Hyperlinks</code> are stored at a level above the <code>Range</code> but can be returned at the <code>Range</code> level.  That is, Excel is storing all of the <code>Hyperlinks</code> in one place and then gives you a convenient function to return the <code>Hyperlinks</code> that are anchored in a given <code>Range</code>.  You will find some real oddities if you output all of the info for the Hyperlinks after copy/pasting them around.  It looks like if you copy a range, you just copy a reference to the Hyperlink and do not get a new one.  </p>

<p>I think if you want to change the Hyperlink and not affect the other one, <strong>you probably need to create a new Hyperlink.</strong></p>

<p>I am using this formula:<br></p>

<pre><code>=IF(ROW()&lt;=COUNTA($A:$A);INDEX($A:$C;ROW();COLUMN(A1));INDEX($A:$C;ROW()-COUNTA($A:$A)+1;COLUMN(C1)))

<p>and I get the values in column <strong>K</strong> as you see. Currently this formula is merging only two columns. <strong>How to modify it to merge all four columns?</strong></p>

<p><br>
And how to only get those values starting from <strong>row 5</strong>?
<br>The column height will vary constantly: sometimes there are 10 values in column A and sometimes there are 2 values.</p>

<p><br><em>Either any excel formula or any VBA code will be acceptable.</em></p>
","<p>This answer is another way of thinking about the formulas you could use for this sort of task.  It gets to the point made by @Jeeped that it is difficult to find unique values in multiple columns.  My first step then is to create a single column.  </p>

<p>If you can live with a helper column, these formulas might be a tad easier to maintain than the nested <code>IFERROR</code> already proposed.  They are equally difficult to understand though at first glance.  The other upside is that it scales nicely if the number of columns involved increases.</p>

<p>It is possible using <code>CHOOSE</code> and some <code>INDEX</code> math to build a single column array of a group of separated columns.  The trick is that <code>CHOOSE</code> will join discontinuous ranges side-by-side when given an array as the selecting parameter.  If this starts with columns of the same size, you can then use division and mod math to turn it into a single column.</p>

<p><strong>Picture of ranges</strong> shows the four groups of data with duplicates colored red.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jaPIP.png"" alt=""picture of ranges""></p>

<p><strong>Formula</strong> in <code>F2:F31</code> is an array formula.  This is combining all of the columns into an array and then back into a single column.  I selected the columns out of order just to emphasize that it is handling a discontinuous range.</p>

<pre><code>=INDEX(CHOOSE({1,2,3,4}, A2:A7,C2:C7,B2:B7,D2:D7), MOD(ROW(1:30)-1, ROWS(A2:A7))+1,INT((ROW(1:30)-1)/ROWS(A2:A7))+1)
</code></pre>

<p>The array formula in <code>H2</code> and copied down is then the standard formula for unique values.  The one exception is that instead of avoiding blanks like normal, I am avoiding 0 values.</p>

<pre><code>=IFERROR(INDEX(F2:F31,MATCH(0,IF(F2:F31=0,1,COUNTIF($H$1:H1,F2:F31)),0)),"""")
</code></pre>

<p>A couple  of other comments about this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the <code>CHOOSE</code>, I am using <code>{1,2,3,4}</code>.  This could be replaced with <code>TRANSPOSE(ROWS(1:4))</code> or whatever number of columns you have.</li>
<li>There is also a <code>ROWS(A2:A7)</code> in 2 places, this could just be <code>2:7</code> or <code>1:6</code> or whatever size was used for the column size.  I used one of the data ranges so that the coloring was simplified and to emphasize it needs to match the size of the block.</li>
<li>And the <code>ROW(1:30)</code> is used for the number of total items to collect.  It really only needs to be <code>1:24</code> since there are <code>6*4</code> items, but I made it big while testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are definitely a couple of downsides to this approach, but it may be a good trick to keep in the toolbox.  Never know when you might want to make a column out of discontinuous ranges.  The largest downside is that the columns of data all need to be the same size (and of course the helper column).</p>

        End If

</code></pre>

<p>This will only delete a few of the rows within the specified range, what could the problem be?</p>
","<p>Here are two common patterns for deleting entire rows based on a condition.  The main idea is that you <strong>cannot delete from a collection while you iterate it</strong>.  This means that <code>Delete</code> should not appear in a <code>For Each</code>  This is fairly standard across most programming languages and some even throw an error to prevent it.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1</strong>, use an integer to track the rows and have it work from the end to the beginning.  You need to go backwards because it is the easy way to avoid skipping rows.  It is possible to go forwards, you just need to account for not incrementing when you delete.</p>

<pre><code>Sub DeleteRowsWithIntegerLoop()

    Dim rng_delete As Range
    Set rng_delete = Range(""A1:A1000"")

    Dim int_start As Integer
    int_start = rng_delete.Rows.Count

    Dim i As Integer
    For i = int_start To 1 Step -1
        If InStr(rng_delete.Cells(i), ""VALUE"") &gt; 0 Then
            rng_delete.Cells(i).EntireRow.Delete
        End If
    Next i

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option 2</strong>, use the <code>Union-Delete</code> pattern to build a range of cells and then delete them all in one step at the end.</p>

<pre><code>Sub DeleteRowsWithUnionDelete()


    Dim rng_cell As Range
    Dim rng_delete As Range

    For Each rng_cell In Range(""A1:A1000"")
        If InStr(rng_cell, ""VALUE"") &gt; 0 Then
            If rng_delete Is Nothing Then
                Set rng_delete = rng_cell
            Else
                Set rng_delete = Union(rng_delete, rng_cell)
            End If
        End If
    Next

    rng_delete.EntireRow.Delete

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Notes on the code</strong></p>

<p>For Option 2, there is an extra conditional there to create <code>rng_delete</code> when it starts at the first item.  <code>Union</code> does not work with a <code>Nothing</code> reference, so we first check that and if so, <code>Set</code> to the first item.  All others come through and get <code>Set</code> by the <code>Union</code> line.</p>

<p><strong>Preference</strong></p>

<p>When choosing between the two, I always prefer Option 2 because I much prefer to work with <code>Ranges</code> in Excel instead of iterating through <code>Cells</code> with a counter.  There are limitations to this.  The second option also works for discontinuous <code>Ranges</code> and all other variety of weird <code>Ranges</code> (e.g. after a call to <code>SpecialCells</code>) which can make it valuable when you are not sure what data you will be dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>

<p>I am not sure about a speed comparison.  Both can be slow if <code>ScreenUpdating</code> and calculations are enabled.  The first option makes <code>N-1</code> calls to <code>Delete</code> whereas the second option does a single one.  <code>Delete</code> is an expensive operation.  Option 2 does however make <code>N-1</code> calls to <code>Union</code> and <code>Set</code>.  I assume it's faster than the first one based on that (and it seems to be here), but I did not profile it.</p>

<p>Final note: <code>InStr</code> returns an integer indicating where the value was found.  I always like to make the boolean covnersion explicit here and compare to <code>&gt;0</code>.</p>

"<p>I have a collection as a global variable, that would have Project Task objects in them.</p>

<p>The structure of my macro would be the following: </p>

<pre><code>Public TaskCollection As Collection
Sub Main()
   Set TaskCollection = New Collection

   GetData(List of project paths)

   For Each task in TaskCollection

            next
        Close project p
         //AFTER THIS, the TaskCollection object will be totally empty
   next
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>As i mentioned in the comments, after I close the project, from where I got the tasks into the TaskCollection, the TaskCollection loses it's values. The weird thing is, that it keeps the number of objects it had before, but they're all empty;</p>

<p>I tried to make a collection object locally in the GetData function, and then pass it in the TaskCollection global variable at the end, but the effect is the same.</p>
","<p>You are adding references to objects when you add a <code>Task</code> to the <code>Collection</code>.  These <strong>references only have meaning so long as the objects they refer to exist</strong>.  Those objects are destroyed when the project is closed.</p>

<p>If you want to use their data, you will need to copy it using value types (<code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code>, etc.) and not refer to the objects.  Or, you can keep the project open until you are done using the objects.</p>

<p>and arrCodes has too many elements to list in the filter. And the stuff that is not in arrCodes is way too numerous to make an array from. Thanks. </p>
","<p>If you want to just use Excel UI and not formulas or VBA, you can do the following simple steps to get an ""inverse"" filter.  This could then be ported to VBA if needed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply the filter with the opposite conditions</li>
<li>Color those cells in one column (either font or background)</li>
<li>Clear the filter</li>
<li>Filter again but this time by cells in that column without color</li>
<li>Copy those results where you want them</li>
</ul>

<p>This will not work well if the column already has some background colors.  If that is the case, you can add a new column and color it.  If this is in VBA, you could automate those steps.  There are limits, but this is quick and simple if it applies.</p>

Sometimes undocumented properties exist, but it is clear from trying that this is not one of those times.</p>

<p>Another indicator is that the <code>Home-&gt;Styles</code> part of the Ribbon is all greyed out once a Chart is selected</p>

<p>If you want to change the <code>Font</code>, you need to go through the properties available there: <code>Bold</code>, <code>Name</code>, etc.</p>

<p>You can apply a <code>ChartStyle</code> to the <code>Chart</code> (<code>Parent</code> of the <code>ChartArea</code>) which is the same as the items in the <code>Chart-&gt;Design</code> gallery in the Ribbon.  Those are indexed by number and it is not obvious how those are determined. You can record a macro to get the desired number though.</p>

<p>Finally, a good idea for getting (some) help from Intellisense is to declare objects.  In this case, <code>Font</code> does not exist on <code>ChartArea</code> which is not that helpful, but the properties are declared for <code>Font</code> when you hit the dot after it.</p>

","<p>When you apply the fonts/sizes to the <code>ChartArea</code> in order to propagate them down to the individual pieces, Excel stores that info at the <code>CharArea</code> level.  If you make a change to the one of the components (<code>ChartTitle</code>, <code>Axis</code>, etc.) and try to run your code again, there is no change on the <code>ChartArea</code>.  Seems that Excel does not propagate those changes ""back up"".  This makes sense since now the different items are styled differently.</p>

<p>The easiest way to deal with this is to reset the styles before you make your changes.  <code>ClearToMatchStyle</code> applied to the <code>Chart</code> (i.e. <code>ActiveChart</code> or <code>Selection.Parent</code> in your context) will do it.

<p>Edit: Sorry about the ambiguity of my question. What I ultimately want to do is actually to be able to change that third last line (that writes the city name to the worksheets) to any function I want so as to modify the worksheets as I see fit. This is actually part of a larger subroutine that I broke out to troubleshoot the problem. These worksheets are interspersed between other worksheets so unfortunately, @nutsch's solution won't really achieve what I want (but thanks either way).</p>

<p>The biggest problem I have with this is that this exact code would sometimes work as intended and other times return the ""subscript out of range"" error on the fourth last line. </p>
","<p>I assume you are trying to put the sheet name into the worksheet it corresponds to?  If so, the problem is that you are using <code>Select</code> instead of <code>Activate</code> to give the <code>Worksheet</code> focus.</p>

<p>The becomes a problem because you are using <code>Cells</code> without a qualifier so it refers to the <code>ActiveSheet</code> which has not been changed in your code.</p>

<p>Two solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>Activate</code> which will make <code>Cells</code> work like you want.</li>
<li>Qualify the call to <code>Cells</code> by preceding it with a sheet object.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>Sub DataTransfer():
    Dim position As Integer, location(1 To 9) As String
    location(1) = ""BC""
    location(2) = ""Calgary""
    location(3) = ""Edmonton""
    location(4) = ""Major Projects""
    location(5) = ""Minneapolis""
    location(6) = ""Saskatchewan""
    location(7) = ""Seattle""
    location(8) = ""Toronto""
    location(9) = ""Winnipeg""

    For position = 1 To 9
        Worksheets(location(position)).Activate
        Cells(1, 2).Value = location(position)
    Next position
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>Sub DataTransfer():
    Dim position As Integer, location(1 To 9) As String
    location(1) = ""BC""
    location(2) = ""Calgary""
    location(3) = ""Edmonton""
    location(4) = ""Major Projects""
    location(5) = ""Minneapolis""
    location(6) = ""Saskatchewan""
    location(7) = ""Seattle""
    location(8) = ""Toronto""
    location(9) = ""Winnipeg""

    For position = 1 To 9
        'this line really does nothign now
        Worksheets(location(position)).Select

        Worksheets(location(position)).Cells(1, 2).Value = location(position)
    Next position
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I prefer Option 2 because it does not require activating the <code>Worksheet</code> first.  It should always be your goal to avoid Activating and Selecting when possible.  They slow things down and make code the opposite of robust.</p>

<p>Finally, as pointed out by @nutsch there are easier ways to do something simialr to this, but it's worth knowing why your code doesn't work.</p>

<p>For whatever reason when it runs the AutoFilter using any numbers for A:D it fails to give any filtered Data. I'm stumped as I said It WILL return filtered data IF I place the exact value I want in the AutoFilter line.</p>

<p>Pretty sure this line is my issue/ problem:
<strong>My_Range.AutoFilter Field:=PickCol, Criteria1:=""=<em>"" &amp; FilterCriteria &amp; ""</em>""</strong></p>

<p>Any Ideas?</p>

<p>I guess now I have to figure out how to actually make that work. Using Autofilter properly on the sheet it works fine. If I have to do as I think the article shows then I have to add 4 more columns AND I have to rewrite the code in the SaveLog Code on the form that generates this list. Sounds like I need to substantially increase the size of my code for everything.  For a Novice as myself I'm certainly overwhelmed at this point. </p>
","<p>The core of this issue is that you cannot use Text comparison operators with Numbers.  <strong>When you add the wildcards <code>*</code> to the search criteria, you are enforcing a Text comparison.</strong></p>

<p>If you want this to work with numbers and text and have the variable column selection, you will need to add some checks to build the criteria correctly.  This would involve dropping the <code>*</code> when a number column is selected.  The main thing to keep in mind is that each data type only has certain filters that are available to it.  To check those, click the arrow in the normal filter menu to see what is listed under <code>Number Filters</code> or <code>Date Filters</code> or <code>Text Filters</code>.</p>

<p>Given all of that, <strong>if you want to filter those numerical columns on <code>Contains</code>, you will need to convert it to text.</strong></p>

<p>Per the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30520060/autofilter-not-seeing-numerical-data-in-filtered-view-multiple-values#comment49119082_30520060"">comment by @Tim Williams</a>, you can convert your numbers to text using the <code>Data-&gt;Text to Columns</code> feature.  You can automate this step using VBA if you know which ranges need to be converted.</p>

<p>The minimum number of parameters required to get that to work appears to be <code>DataType</code> and <code>FieldInfo</code>.  <code>FieldInfo</code> is the important one for forcing the conversion.</p>

<pre><code>Sub ConvertColumnNumberToText()

    Dim rng_column As Range
    For Each rng_column In Range(""B:D"").Columns
        rng_column.TextToColumns DataType:=xlDelimited, FieldInfo:=Array(1, 2)
    Next rng_column

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Check the documentation for <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff193593.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">TextToColumns</a> to see what the parameters are.  It will only work on a column at a time, hence the loop.</p>

<p>Also, there is little harm in running this code multiple times, so long as it only runs on columns with numbers only.  If you accidentally run it on a column that can be split into columns (contains a <code>TAB</code> by default), you will start to overwrite other columns.</p>

","<p>You only get that error for one reason: <strong>the name your provided does not exist in the collection!</strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of likely reasons for this based on your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your <code>nsName</code> variable contains hidden characters that make it different even though it appears correct.</li>
<li>You are looking for the sheet in the wrong workbook.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on your comments, <strong>it seems that you are looking in the wrong workbook</strong>. A good way to check out these subscript errors is to iterate the collection and print out the <code>Names</code> included therein.</p>

<pre><code>Dim sht as Worksheet    
For Each sht In tempWB.Sheets
    Debug.Print sht.Name
Next sht
</code></pre>

<p>In general, it is desirable to get rid of calls to <code>Select</code> and <code>Activate</code> so that you are not relying on the interface in order to get objects.  See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10714251/how-to-avoid-using-select-in-excel-vba-macros"">this post about avoiding <code>Select</code> and <code>Activate</code></a> for more info.</p>

<p>One idea applied to your code is to assign the Workbooks directly without <code>ActiveWorkbook</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Set tempWB = Workbooks.Open(asrSheet.Range(""B"" &amp; a).Value)
Set dataWB = Workbooks.Open(asrSheet.Range(""C"" &amp; a).Value)
</code></pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre><code>    Workbooks.Open Range(""B"" &amp; a).Value
    Set tempWB = ActiveWorkbook
    'tempWB.Windows(1).Visible = False

    AutoSR.Activate

    Workbooks.Open Range(""C"" &amp; a).Value

","<p>There is a bit of code I call the ""waterfall fill"" which does exactly this.  If you can build a range of cells to fill (i.e. set <code>rng_in</code>), it will do it.  It works on any number of columns which is a nice feature.  You can honestly feed it a range of <code>A:D</code> and it will polish off your blanks.</p>

<pre><code>Sub FillValueDown()

    Dim rng_in As Range
    Set rng_in = Range(""B:B"")

    On Error Resume Next

        Dim rng_cell As Range
        For Each rng_cell In rng_in.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeBlanks)
            rng_cell = rng_cell.End(xlUp)
        Next rng_cell

    On Error GoTo 0

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FzRce.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<p>This code works by getting a range of all the blank cells.  By default <code>SpecialCells</code> only looks into the <code>UsedRange</code> because of a <a href=""http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/371987-problem-specialcells-xlcelltypeblanks.html#post1844081"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quirk with <code>xlCellTypeBlanks</code></a>.  From there it sets the value of the blank cell equal to the closest cell on top of it using <code>End(xlUp)</code>.  The error handling is in place because <code>xlCellTypeBlanks</code> will return an error if nothing is found.  If you do the whole column with a blank row at top though (like the picture), the error will never get triggered.</p>

This is nice because it means that all of <strong>your values are stored as Numbers and not Text and math works like normal</strong>.</p>

<p>Overall steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new conditional formatting for each block of 1000 that applies the number format for that block</li>
<li>Add the largest condition at the top so it formats first</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat to get all the ones you want</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conditional formatting</strong> used to style column <code>C</code> which is just random data at different powers of ten.  It is the same number as column <code>D</code> just styled differently.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLI9a.png"" alt=""conditional setup""></p>

<p><strong>Number formats</strong>, are pretty easy since they are the same as <a href=""http://www.excel-easy.com/examples/custom-number-format.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">that link, see Large Numbers section</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>ones = <code>0 "" ""</code></li>
<li>thousands = <code>0, "" k""</code></li>
<li>millions = <code>0,, "" M""</code></li>
<li>and so on for however many you want</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Automation</strong>, if you don't want to click and type all day, here is some VBA that will create all the conditional formatting for you (for current <code>Selection</code>).  This example goes out to billions.  Keep adding powers of 3 by extending the <code>Array</code> with more entries.</p>

<pre><code>Sub CreateConditionalsForFormatting()

    'add these in as powers of 3, starting at 1 = 10^0
    Dim arr_markers As Variant
    arr_markers = Array("""", ""k"", ""M"", ""B"")

    For i = UBound(arr_markers) To 0 Step -1

        With Selection.FormatConditions.Add(xlCellValue, xlGreaterEqual, 10 ^ (3 * i))
            .NumberFormat = ""0"" &amp; Application.WorksheetFunction.Rept("","", i) &amp; "" """" "" &amp; arr_markers(i) &amp; """"""""
            .StopIfTrue = False
        End With

    Next

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I change the <code>StopIfTrue</code> value so that this does not break other conditional formatting that might exist.  If the largest condition is at the top (added first) then the <code>NumberFormat</code> from that one holds.  By default, these are created with <code>StopIfTrue = True</code>.  This is a moot point if you do not have any other conditional formatting on these cells.</p>

"<p>I'm  trying to figure out how to split rows of data where columns B,C,D in the row contain multiple lines and others do not.  I've figured out how to split the multi-line cells if I copy just those columns into a new sheet, manually insert rows, and then run the macro below (that's just for column A), but I'm lost at coding the rest. </p>

    Loop
    If Len(Trim(strTemp)) &gt; 0 Then
        iRow = iRow + 1
        Cells(iRow, 2) = strTemp
    End If

","<p>This is a fairly interesting question and something I have seen variations of before.  I went ahead and wrote up a general solution for it since it seems like a useful bit of code to keep for myself.</p>

<p>There are pretty much only two assumptions I make about the data:</p>

<ul>
<li>Returns are represented by <code>Chr(10)</code> or which is the <code>vbLf</code> constant.</li>
<li>Data that belongs with a lower row has enough returns in it to make it line up.  This appears to be your case since there are return characters which appear to make things line up like you want.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pictures of the output</strong>, zoomed out to show all the data for <code>A:D</code>.  Note that the code below <strong>processes all of the columns by default and outputs to a new sheet</strong>. You can limit the columns if you want, but it was <em>too</em> tempting to make it general.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6bo3f.png"" alt=""output of the code""></p>

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<pre><code>Sub SplitByRowsAndFillBlanks()

    'process the whole sheet, could be
    'Intersect(Range(""B:D""), ActiveSheet.UsedRange)
    'if you just want those columns
    Dim rng_all_data As Range
    Set rng_all_data = Range(""A1"").CurrentRegion

    Dim int_row As Integer
    int_row = 0

    Next

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<p>There are comments within the code to highlight what is going on.  Here is a high level overview:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overall, we iterate through each row of the data, processing all of the columns individually.</li>
<li>The text of the current cell is <code>Split</code> using the <code>vbLf</code>.  This gives an array of all the individual lines.</li>
<li>A counter is tracking the maximum number of rows that were added (really this is <code>rows-1</code> since these arrays are <code>0-indexed</code>.</li>
<li>Now the data can be output to the new sheet.  This is easy because we can just dump the array that <code>Split</code> created for us.  The only tricky part is getting it to the right spot on the sheet.  To that end, there is a counter for the current column offset and a global counter to determine how many total rows need to be offset.  The <code>Offset</code> moves us to the right cell; the <code>Resize</code> ensures that all of the rows are output.  Finally, <code>Application.Transpose</code> is needed because <code>Split</code> returns a row array and we're dumping a column.</li>
<li>Update the counters.  Column offset is incremented every time.  The row offset is updated to add enough rows to cover the last maximum (<code>+1</code> since this is <code>0-indexed</code>)</li>
<li>Finally, I get to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30537813/count-lines-of-text-in-a-cell/30538117#30538117"">use my waterfall fill (your previous question)</a> on all of the blanks cells that were created to ensure no blanks.  I forgo error checking because I assume blanks exist.</li>

","<p>Here is a formula and VBA route that gives you the <code>STDEV.S</code> for each set of items.</p>

<p><strong>Picture</strong> shows the various ranges and results.  My input is the same as yours, but I accidentally sorted it at one point so they don't line up.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/APJ2e.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Some notes</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ARRAY</code> is the actual answer you want.  <code>NON-ARRAY</code> showing for later.</li>
<li>I included the PivotTable to test the accuracy of the method.</li>
<li><code>VBA</code> is the same answer as <code>ARRAY</code> calculated as a UDF which could be used elsewhere in your VBA.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Formula</strong> in cell <code>D3</code> is an array formula entered with CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.  That same formula is in <code>E3</code> without the array entry.  Both have been copied down to the end of the data.</p>

<pre><code>=STDEV.S(IF(B3=$B$3:$B$21,$C$3:$C$21))
</code></pre>

<p>Since it seems you need a VBA version of this, you can use the same formula in VBA and just wrap it in <code>Application.Evaluate</code>. This is pretty much how @Jeeped gets an answer, converting the range to values which meet the criteria.</p>

<p><strong>VBA Code</strong> uses <code>Evaluate</code> to process a formula string built from the ranges given as input.</p>

<pre><code>Public Function STDEV_S_IF(rng_criteria As Range, rng_criterion As Range, rng_values As Range) As Variant

    Dim str_frm As String

    'formula to reproduce
    '=STDEV.S(IF(B3=$B$3:$B$21,$C$3:$C$21))

    str_frm = ""STDEV.S(IF("" &amp; _
        rng_criterion.Address &amp; ""="" &amp; _
        rng_criteria.Address &amp; "","" &amp; _
        rng_values.Address &amp; ""))""

    'if you have more than one sheet, be sure it evalutes in the right context
    'or add the sheet name to the references above
    'single sheet works fine with just Application.Evaluate

    'STDEV_S_IF = Application.Evaluate(str_frm)
    STDEV_S_IF = Sheets(""Sheet2"").Evaluate(str_frm)

End Function
</code></pre>

<p>The formula in <code>F3</code> is the VBA UDF of the same formula as above, it is entered as a normal formula (although entering as an array does not affect anything) and is copied down to the end.</p>

<pre><code>=STDEV_S_IF($B$3:$B$21,B3,$C$3:$C$21)
</code></pre>

<p>It is worth noting that <code>.Evaluate</code> processes this correctly as an array formula.  You can compare this against the <code>NON-ARRAY</code> column included in the output.  I am not certain how Excel knows to treat it this way.  There was previously <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30314570/vba-long-array-formula-via-application-evaluate"">a fairly extended conversion about how <code>Evaluate</code> process array formulas and determines the output</a>.  This is tangentially related to that conversation.</p>

<p>And for completeness, here is the test of the <code>Sub</code> side of things.  I am running this code in a module with a sheet other than <code>Sheet2</code> active.  This emphasizes the ability of using <code>Sheets(""Sheets2"").Evaluate</code> for a multi-sheet workbook since my <code>Range</code> call is technically misqualified.  Console output is included.</p>

<pre><code>Sub test()

    Debug.Print STDEV_S_IF(Range(""B3:B21""), Range(""B3""), Range(""C3:C21""))
    'correctly returns  206.301357242263

","<p>One option is to create an array of the values, quick sort the array, and then iterate the sorted array to create the report.  This works even if there are  duplicates in the source data (<strong>edited</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Notes on the code:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have taken the Quick Sort code from this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/152325/4288101"">previous answer</a> and added <code>UCase</code> to the comparisons for case-insensitive searching and made parameters <code>Optional</code> (and <code>Variant</code> for that to work).</li>
<li>The <code>Find/FindNext</code> part is going through the original data and locating the sorted items therein.  If a duplicate is found (that is, if the current value matches the previous value) then it uses <code>FindNext</code> starting at the previously found entry.</li>
<li>My report generation is just taking the values from the data table.  <code>rng_search</code> holds the <code>Range</code> of the current item in the original data source.</li>
<li>I am using <code>Application.Tranpose</code> to force <code>.Value</code> to be a <code>1-D</code> array instead of the multi-dim like normal.  See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/7651439/4288101"">this answer for that usage</a>.  Transpose the array again if you want to output into a column again.</li>
<li>The <code>Select Case</code> bit is just a hacky way of doing short-circuit evaluation in VBA.  See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/3245183/4288101"">this previous answer</a> about the usage of that.</li>

"<p>I have a set of data where each item has a 2D array of information corresponding to it. I'd like to create a 3D array where the first dimension is the item name and the second and third dimensions are taken up by the info corresponding to the item.</p>

<p>I can read the data for each item into a 2D array, but I can't figure out how to get the 2D array read into the 3D array.</p>

<p>I know the sizes of all the dimensions so I can create an array of fixed size before I begin the reading and writing process.</p>

<p>I'd like to do this by looping only through the names of the items and not looping through every cell of every 2D array.</p>

<p>It is easy to get the 2D arrays read in to an ArrayList but I want to be able to name the items and be able to read these back in to excel and it seems difficult to do with an ArrayList.</p>

<p>The question is: how do I read a 2D selection from excel into a 3D fixed sized array in VBA?</p>
","<p>Here is an example of each approach: array of arrays or <code>Dictionary</code> of arrays.  The <strong>Dictionary approach is considerably easier</strong> than the array of arrays if what you want is keyed lookup of values.  There might be merits to the array of arrays in other cases.</p>

<p>This is dummy code with no real purpose but to show a couple things: grabbing a single value and an array of values.  I am building a 2D array of values by grabbing some <code>Range</code> data which is easy and 2D.  From there I build up the arrays of these values and then put them into the relevant data structure.  Then I poke at the data structure to get some values out of it.</p>

<p><strong>Array of Arrays approach</strong> is shown first (and outputs on the left of the picture).</p>

<pre><code>Sub ArraysOfArrays()

    Dim arrA() As Variant
    Dim arrB() As Variant

    'wire up a 2-D array
    arrA = Range(""B2:D4"").Value
    arrB = Range(""F2:H4"").Value

    Dim arrCombo() As Variant
    ReDim arrCombo(2, 1) As Variant

    'name and give data
    arrCombo(0, 0) = ""arrA""
    arrCombo(1, 0) = arrA

    'add more elements
    ReDim Preserve arrCombo(2, 2)

    arrCombo(0, 1) = ""arrB""
    arrCombo(1, 1) = arrB

    'output a single result
    'cell(2,2) of arrA
    Range(""B6"") = arrCombo(1, 0)(2, 2)

    Dim str_search As String
    str_search = ""arrB""

    'iterate through and output arrB to cells
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = LBound(arrCombo, 1) To UBound(arrCombo, 1)
        If arrCombo(0, i) = str_search Then
            Range(""B8"").Resize(3, 3).Value = arrCombo(1, i)
        End If
    Next i
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Couple key points here:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can only expand the array using <code>ReDim</code>.  <code>ReDim</code> is very particular that you only <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/13184027/4288101"">change the last dimension of the array</a> when used with <code>Preserve</code>.  Since I need one of them to track the number of entries, I do that in the second index which is... unnatural.  If you know the size in advance, this painful step is skipped.</li>
<li>My final array is a 2xN array where the 2 contains a name and a YxZ array of data.</li>
<li>In order to find a given array in the mix, you have to iterate through them all.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dictionary of Arrays</strong> is far less code and more elegant.  Be sure to add the reference <code>Tools-&gt;References</code> in the VBA editor to Microsoft Scripting Runtime.</p>

<pre><code>Sub DictionaryOfArrays()

    Dim dict As New Scripting.Dictionary

    'wire up a 2-D array
    arrA = Range(""B2:D4"").Value
    arrB = Range(""F2:H4"").Value

    dict.Add ""arrA"", arrA
    dict.Add ""arrB"", arrB

    'get a single value
    Range(""F6"") = dict(""arrB"")(2, 2)

    'get a array of values
    Range(""F8"").Resize(3, 3) = dict(""arrA"")

<p>Any suggestions on how I can use the inputted value to search through the customer data base and find more than what was inputted and place that in a new worksheet?</p>

03-Jan-12   145         $332    
</code></pre>
","<p>Here is another approach which takes advantage of straight forward Excel features to <code>Copy</code> the customer IDs column, <code>RemoveDuplicates</code>, <code>SUMIF</code> based on customer, and <code>Delete</code> those rows over the minimum.</p>

<pre><code>Sub CopyFilterAndCountIf()

    Dim dbl_min As Double
    dbl_min = InputBox(""enter minimum search"")

    Dim sht_data As Worksheet
    Dim sht_out As Worksheet

    Set sht_data = ActiveSheet
    Set sht_out = Worksheets.Add()

    sht_data.Range(""B:B"").Copy sht_out.Range(""A:A"")
    sht_out.Range(""A:A"").RemoveDuplicates 1, xlYes

    Dim i As Integer
    For i = sht_out.UsedRange.Rows.Count To 2 Step -1
        If WorksheetFunction.SumIf( _
            sht_data.Range(""B:B""), sht_out.Cells(i, 1), sht_data.Range(""C:C"")) &lt; dbl_min Then
            sht_out.Cells(i, 1).EntireRow.Delete
        End If
    Next
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I don't do error checking on the input, but you can add that in.  I am also taking advantage of Excel's willingness to process entire columns instead of dealing with finding ranges. Definitely makes it easier to understand the code.</p>

<p>It should also be mentioned that you can accomplish all of these same features by using a Pivot Table with a filter on the <code>Sum</code> and no VBA.</p>

","<p>You can knock this out pretty quickly taking advantage of a how <code>Font</code> returns the <code>Color</code> for a set of characters that do not have the same color: it returns <code>Null</code>!  Knowing this, you can iterate through the characters 2 at a time and find the first spot where it throws <code>Null</code>.  You now know that the color shift is there and can spit out the pieces using <code>Mid</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong> makes use of this behavior and <code>IsNull</code> to iterate through a fixed <code>Range</code>.  Define the <code>Range</code> however you want to get the cells.  By default it spits them out in the neighboring two columns with <code>Offset</code>.</p>

","<p>You will make things easier if you give them the same categories and use blanks to skip missing entries.  Excel is not very smart about matching categories between different sets of data unless you are using scatter plots.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to use STRCONV vbPropercase to correct input in a macro that I use to copy data from one ""input"" worksheet to another.  I have been able to assign specific variables to cells and then apply the STRCONV Propercase to the variable, but no change is made to the text in the cell when I do this.  The code saves the file as a combination of the variable names, so I know that it makes the corrections there.  How do I make the change appear in the cell and not just to the variable in the code? </p>

"<p>Excel 2013. I am using 3 combo boxes to change filters on the pivot table. 
My first combo box has ""Project1"", ""Project2"" &amp; All. 
My second combo box has ""Customer1"", ""Customer2"" &amp; All. 
My third combo box has ""Country1"", ""Country2"" &amp; All.</p>

<p>I am using 9 pivot tables, all of them have filters as [Project], [Customer], [Country]. </p>

<p>My intention is to change first combo box to Project1 &amp; all the pivot tables filter should change as Project1.I am successfully able to do that. </p>

<p>However when I select the first combo box as ""All"". First Combo box cell link to Y1. I get VBA Run time error 1004: Application-defined or object-defined error.</p>

","<p>Since the first three lines of code go without issue, I will assume that the Pivot Table <code>PVT1</code> and the Field <code>Project Name</code> all exist.  This places the error somewhere after that.</p>

<p>For the call to <code>.CurrentPage</code> you will get a 1004 error for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using this to try and filter any field that is not set as a <code>Report Filter</code>.  You cannot use the <code>CurrentPage</code> to filter any rows or columns</li>
<li>Setting a value which does not exist in the list of possible values</li>
</ul>

<p>On the second point, this is where the call to <code>Range</code> might be relevant.</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify that the value there exists in the list of possible ones.</li>
<li>Also be aware you are using <code>.Text</code> which will use the <em>display</em> value of the cell and not its underlying <code>.Value</code></li>
</ul>

<p>To resolve these issues, there are a couple of options:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the case where you want to filter data that is on the row or column (and not in the filters section) you can go through <code>PivotItems</code> and set <code>Visible = True/False</code></li>
<li>You can also set a label filter from VBA if you want that instead of the manual filter</li>
<li>If you want to check for a value existing in the <code>CurrentPage</code>, you can iterate the <code>PivotItems</code> for that <code>PivotField</code> and check that one matches.  The code for that is very similar to the <code>For Each</code> loop with the check on value, just don't set <code>Visible</code>.</li>

"<p>This is the first time I have ever really worked with VBA stuff (the code I found is VBA right? :P ) so please forgive my inability to just...understand it by looking at it. :) I have experience with macros and know /some/ of that code is compatible, but I don't know how to write it...only know how to record it then use the bits I know work.</p>

<p>The Puzzle: I have a column which will adjust the weighted values of the row it is in (either makes the values slightly more or less, or leaves them alone), but the weights are entirely subjective so only need to be changed manually usually.</p>

<p>The issue is when needing to change a lot of them at once because it is tons of clicking each cell and changing the value one at a time by ""guessing"" which weights we need by entering numbers until it ""looks good"" (like I said subjective), so I found this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/51933-changing-cell-value-clicking-cell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/51933-changing-cell-value-clicking-cell.html</a></p>

<p>Made some tiny changes to the version at the bottom of the page and have this right now:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Excel.Range)
  Application.EnableEvents = False
  If Target.Cells.Count = 1 Then
    If Not Intersect(Target, Range(""Q3:Q500"")) Is Nothing Then
      Select Case Target.Value
      Case """"
        Target.Value = ""+""
      Case ""+""
        Target.Value = ""-""
      Case ""-""
        Target.Value = """"
      Case Else
        Target.Value = ""+""
      End Select
        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 2).Range(""A1"").Select
    End If
  End If
  Application.EnableEvents = True
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Almost perfect, except the range of numbers will be slightly larger than """", +, or -. In fact the range will likely be 0.5 to 1.5 (50% to 150%).</p>

<p>It would be best if they could go up or down. I guess I could just create a huge list of replacements so instead of """", +, or - it would just be the numbers (Case 0.5 > Case 0.6 > Case 0.7 >>> Case 1 > Case 1.1 >>> Etc.) but obviously that would probably be a huge nightmare and /less/ efficient when having to click the cell 10 times to cycle through the numbers.</p>

<p>So there are two things I need to make it work perfectly:</p>

<ol>
<li>For it to change the NEXT cell over, either to the left or right by one. </li>
<li>Instead of simple replacements, is it possible for it to do some math?</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is that clicking in column P to the left of Q will decrease the weight (by say 0.1), and by clicking in column R to the right of Q it will increase the weight slightly. And if they reach the bottom/top it will go to the other end (0.5 decreased will take the value up to 1.5, vice versa).</p>

<p>I tried tinkering a little with what I know about macros and tried adding the ""ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range(""A1"").Select"" bit here and there, which will be nice for the end of the code so I can choose where the cursor is left afterwards...but putting it anywhere earlier...I see the active cell move to P or R before changes are made, but it still changes the original column Q.</p>

<p>I recognize I will need two copies of the code, one for Column R (decreasing) and one for Column P (increasing) but so long as I have at least one side I should be able to make the changes to mirror it. Also I know Data Validation might seem like a simple solution, but having an obscene amount of drop down arrows covering most of the sheet will make it illegible...</p>

<p>Thank you so much to anyone spending any time on helping to solve this puzzle,
Corinne :)</p>
","<p>I think I understand your question, if this doesn't do it, please add a picture and we'll get there.</p>

<p>Changing the <code>Value</code> based on <code>Value</code> is straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong> shows how to handle clicks (or arrow movements) into columns <code>P</code> or <code>R</code>.  Going into <code>P</code> will decrease the value (with the wraparound like you mention).  Going into <code>R</code> will go up.</p>

  Application.EnableEvents = False
  If Target.Cells.Count = 1 Then
    If Not Intersect(Target, Range(""P3:P500"")) Is Nothing Then

        If Target.Offset(0, 1).Value &gt; 0.5 Then
            Target.Offset(0, 1).Value = Target.Offset(0, 1).Value - 0.1
        Else
            Target.Offset(0, 1).Value = 1.5
        End If

        Target.Offset(0, 1).Select
    End If

    If Not Intersect(Target, Range(""R3:R500"")) Is Nothing Then

        If Target.Offset(0, -1).Value &lt; 1.5 Then
            Target.Offset(0, -1).Value = Target.Offset(0, -1).Value + 0.1
        Else
            Target.Offset(0, -1).Value = 0.5
        End If

        Target.Offset(0, -1).Select
    End If


  End If
  Application.EnableEvents = True
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The main idea is to check the value in column <code>Q</code> and add or subtract or wrap around depending on column and value.  This code can be simplified and cleaned up, but it works which may be all you need.</p>

<p><em>I am assuming that you have a number in column <code>Q</code> and are trying to increase or decrease that?  If not, please add more detail.</em></p>

<p><strong>The nice part of this code is that it puts the selection back into column <code>Q</code>. This means that you can repeatedly hit the right or left arrow to increase or decrease, respectively</strong>.  This works because the selection changes but then is immediately put back in the center.  You can type fast and increment or decrement as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Picture</strong> shows the assumption of data in column <code>Q</code>.  I used the code a couple times to change values to what is shown.</p>

<li>The original** headers and row names and values relevant to the aggregate being selected (e.g. FieldX = 2013, FieldY=""X""), that will enable me to filter the source sheet and present the underlying rows.</li>
</ul>

<p>** Note that I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I extensively stumble upon PivotTables in which the row names shown are not the same as those in the source datasheet (by manually renaming them in the PivotTable). Also, is it possible to extract the 'groupings' created in the PivotTables?</p>

<p>Using these characteristics, the VBA for locating the source data and applying the relevant filters should be relatively straightforward. In most cases, the source table is an 'Excel Table', if this is relevant.</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>The solution to this depends greatly on the filters you have in place.  The way that <code>PivotFilters</code> are defined is different from the way that AutoFilters are defined.  This means that you will need to do a translation for each type of filter that is in place.</p>

<p>AutoFilters do all of their magic in the <code>Criteria1</code> whereas the <code>PivotFilters</code> have a <code>FilterType</code> and <code>Value1</code> to make it work.  This is the translation step.</p>

<p>For simple equality, it is fairly easy and that is the code included below.  It address the issue of how to find the column header and set the filter.</p>

<p>Couple of notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am using <code>PivotTable.SourceData</code> to get the range of cells that are involved.  This returns a value in R1C1 notation, so I convert it to A1 notation using <code>Application.ConvertFormula</code>.  I then need to use <code>Application.Range</code> to look up this string.  (Since this code is executing within the scope of a specific <code>Worksheet</code> you need to add <code>Application</code> here so it expands the scope of the search)</li>
<li>After that it is a simple matter of iterating through all the PivotFields and their PivotFilters.</li>
<li>Inside that loop, then you need to find the column header (using <code>Application.Match</code> in the header row: <code>.Rows(1)</code>) and add the filter.  This is where the conversion steps are required.  You could do a <code>Select... Case</code> for each supported type of filter.</li>
<li>You might also want to check out <code>CurrentPage</code> if any of the fields is a filter instead of a row/column.</li>
<li>Finally, it is possible for there to be manual filters instead of the label filters which I am iterating through.  You can loop through <code>PivotItems</code> and check for <code>Visible</code> if you want those.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this code gets you started but also hints at the complexity of the task involved.  You will likely want to limit yourself to supporting specific types of filters.</p>

","<p>Should be able to <code>Set</code> those as the <code>Range</code> version.  You also will do better to assign the series variables to actual <code>Ranges</code> instead of addresses as strings.  Really, you should just <code>Set</code> directly which is what I have below.</p>

<p>Full code should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>Dim CellX1 As Integer

"<p>I am trying to create a dynamic table - I have tried a Pivot Table, but cannot get it to work. So I thought that maybe it could be done with an IF-statement, but that did not work for me neither.  </p>

<p>Basically, I have 2 tables, 1 table containing the information (data source table) and 1 table that should be dynamic according to the data in the first table.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/atIAv.gif"" alt=""Table 1""></p>

<p>So if I change the data in the E-column, the Fruit table (image below) must be updated accordingly.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/grVqB.gif"" alt=""Table 2""></p>

<p>So if I write 2 instead of 1 in the count of Apples, then it should create 2 apples under the ""Fruit""-column"". Data in the remaining columns will be calculated with a formula/fixed data - so that is not important.<br>
I am open to any solutions; formulas, pivot tables, VBA, etc.</p>

<p>Have a nice weekend.
I have both Excel 2010 and 2013.</p>
","<p>If you want to repeat some text a number of times you can use a somewhat complicated formula to do it.  It relies on there not being duplicate entries in the <code>Fruits</code> table and no entries with 0 count.</p>

<p><strong>Picture of ranges and results</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/syPpQ.png"" alt=""ranges and results""></p>

<p><strong>Formulas</strong> involved include a starter cell <code>E2</code> and a repeating entry <code>E3</code> and copied down.  These are actually <em>normal</em> formulas, no array required.  Note that I have created a <code>Table</code> for the data which allows me to use named fields to get the whole column.</p>

<pre><code>E2 = INDEX(Table1[Fruits],1)
E3 = IF(
      INDEX(Table1[Count],MATCH(E2,Table1[Fruits],0))&gt;COUNTIF($E$2:E2,E2),
      E2,
      INDEX(Table1[Fruits],MATCH(E2,Table1[Fruits],0)+1))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How it works</strong>
This formula relies on checking the number of entries above the current one and comparing to the desired count.  Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The starter cell is needed to get the first result.  </li>
<li>After the first cell, it counts how often the value above appears in the total list.  This is compared to the desired count.  If less than desired, it will repeat the value from above.  If greater, it will go to the next item in the list.  There is a dual relative/absolute reference in here to count cells above.</li>
<li>Since it goes to the next item in the list, don't put a 0 for a count or it will get included once.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can copy this down for as many cells as you want.  It will <code>#REF!</code> when it runs out of data.  You can wrap in an <code>IFERROR(..., """")</code> to make these display pretty.</p>

<p>If the non-0 rule is too much, it can probably be removed with a little effort.  If there are duplicates, that will be much harder to deal with.</p>

But when I paste the code into a command button, it gives me a couple of runtime error 1004's.

","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>, couple options to resolve this, in order of preference:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/10714251/4288101"">Stop using <code>Select</code></a> to access cells</li>
<li>Qualify your call to <code>Range(""E4"")</code> when executing code in a <code>Worksheet</code> object by using <code>Application.Range(""E4"")</code> or <code>Sheets(""Draft"").Range(""E4"")</code> or <code>ActiveSheet.Range(""E4"")</code></li>
<li>Move the code to <code>ThisWorkbook</code> or a code module and call that <code>Sub</code> from the event.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Here is the lengthy part that attempts to explain <em>why</em> your code does not work.</p>

<p>This all comes down to: where is the code executing?  Different execution contexts will behave differently when you use unqualified references to <code>Cells</code> <code>Range</code> and a number of other functions.</p>

<p>Your original code likely ran inside <code>ThisWorkbook</code>, a code module, or possibly in the code file for sheet <code>Draft</code>.  Why do I guess this?  Because in all of those places a call to <code>Range(""E4"")</code> would be acceptable to get the cell <code>E4</code> on sheet <code>Draft</code>.  Cases:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ThisWorkbook</code>and a code module will execute <code>Range</code> on the <code>ActiveSheet</code> which is <code>Draft</code> since you just called <code>Select</code> on it.</li>
<li>Inside <code>Draft</code> will execute <code>Range</code> in the context of <code>Draft</code> which is acceptable since that is the <code>ActiveSheet</code> and the place where you are trying to get cell <code>E4</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now what happens when we add an ActiveX <code>CommandButton</code> to the mix?  Well that code is added to the <code>Worksheet</code> where it lives. This means that the code for the button can possibly execute in a different context than it did before.  The only exception to this is if the button and code are both on sheet <code>Drafts</code>, which I assume not since you <code>Select</code> that sheet.  For demonstrations, let's say the button is located on sheet <code>WHERE_THE_BUTTON_IS</code>.</p>

<p>Given that sheet, what is going on now?  Your call to <code>Range</code> is now executed in the context of sheet <code>WHERE_THE_BUTTON_IS</code> <strong>regardless</strong> of the <code>ActiveSheet</code> or anything else you do outside of the call to <code>Range</code>.  This is because the call to <code>Range</code> is <em>unqualified</em>.  That is, there is no object to provide scope to the call so it runs in the current scope which is the <code>Worksheet</code>.</p>

<p>So now we have a call to <code>Range(""E4"")</code> in sheet <code>WHERE_THE_BUTTON_IS</code> which is trying to <code>Select</code> the cell.  This is forbidden because sheet <code>Draft</code> is the <code>ActiveSheet</code> and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Thou shalt not <code>Select</code> a cell on a <code>Worksheet</code> that is not the <code>ActiveSheet</code></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So with all of this, how do we resolve this issue?  There are a couple of ways out:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/10714251/4288101"">Stop using <code>Select</code> to manipulate cells</a></strong>.  This gets away from the main problem here, quoted above.  This assumes your button lives on the same sheet as the <code>Selection</code> to copy/paste.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<pre><code>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

    Sheets(""Draft"").Range(""E4"").End(xlDown).Offset(1).Value = Selection.Value

End Sub
</code></pre>

<hr>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>Qualify the call to <code>Range</code></strong> so that it executes in the proper context and chooses the right cell.  You can use the <code>Sheets(""Draft"").Range</code> object to qualify this or <code>Application.Range</code> instead of the bare <code>Range</code>.  I highly recommend option 1 instead of trying to figure out how to make <code>Select</code> work.</li>

<p><strong>Notes on the code</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ranges are built on <code>CurrentRegion</code> which picks out the blocks of data.  You can swap these out for different ranges on different sheets.</li>
<li>Column header translation is done with <code>Application.VLookup</code> to check the source header and return the destination header.  This <code>String</code> is then found in the destination header row using <code>Application.Match</code>.  You could abstract this code into a <code>Function</code> to avoid repeating it twice.</li>
<li>Once the column is found, the ID is searched for in the destination table using <code>Application.Match</code>.  This will return an error if the ID is not found.</li>
<li>If the ID is found, it then checks all of the other values in the same row, comparing them against the correct columns in the destination table.  Non-matching results are colored red.</li>
<li>If all of the columns do not have pairs, you can add additional checks on the <code>VLookup</code> or the column <code>Match</code> to check this.</li>
<li>The vast majority of this code just handles getting to the correct spots in the data using <code>Intersect</code>, <code>Rows</code>, and <code>Columns</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Results</strong> show some red values for the ID not found and the values that don't match.</p>

","<p>After some quick testing, I am able to reproduce your error if I declare <code>TBox as TextBox</code>.  I do not get an error if I declare <code>TBox as MSForms.TextBox</code>.  I would recommend declaring all your <code>TextBox</code> variables with the <code>MSForms</code> qualifier.</p>

<p><strong>Test code</strong> is situated similar to yours.  I have a <code>MultiPage</code> with a <code>Frame</code> where I am adding a <code>Control</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

    Dim obj As Object
    Set obj = Me.MultiPage1.Pages(0).Controls(""Frame1"")

    Dim lbl As Control
    Set lbl = obj.Add(""Forms.TextBox.1"", ""txt"", True)

    If TypeOf lbl Is TextBox Then
        Debug.Print ""textbox found1"" 'does not execute
    End If

    If TypeOf lbl Is MSForms.TextBox Then
        Debug.Print ""textbox found2""

        Dim txt1 As MSForms.TextBox
        Set txt1 = lbl 'no error
    End If

    If TypeOf lbl Is MSForms.TextBox Then
        Debug.Print ""textbox found3""

        Dim txt As TextBox
        Set txt = lbl 'throws an error
    End If

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure why the qualifier is needed for <code>TextBox</code> and not <code>ComboBox</code>.  As you can see above, a good test for this is the <code>If TypeOf ... Is ... Then</code> to test which objects are which types.  I included the first block to show that <code>lbl</code> is not a ""bare"" <code>TextBox</code>, but, again, I have no idea why that is.  Maybe there is another type of <code>TextBox</code> out there that overrides the default declaration?</p>

<p>It was intended to work for a single cell value for each row in a range to be sent to another cell before printing, so that several copies can be printed, each with a different name on it for rationalization, such as with printing time cards to distribute to each employee.  </p>

<p>However, I have not been able to figure out how to apply this to sending a range of three cells (in columns <strong><code>A:C</code></strong> from Employees table) for each row to another range of three cells (<strong><code>X50:X52</code></strong> in <strong><code>Sheet1</code></strong>, instead of just the one cell.

","<p>You can use <code>Application.Transpose</code> to flip the row of data into a column of data.

<p>which is as expected, but in the code module itself the line is changed to</p>

<p>DimAll has been replaced by Dim -- but the rest of the line is unmodified. I suspect that the commas are confusing the ReplaceLine method. Any ideas of how to fix this?</p>

","<p>You have fallen victim to the odd behavior of <code>WorksheetFunction.Match</code> when it cannot find a match.  Instead of returning the error, it throws a run time error which gums up the works.</p>

<p>Since the premise of this question is searching for whether or not something is in a list, you are nearly guaranteed to see this issue since you expect to have some items that will not show up.  In the formula version of <code>MATCH</code> you would get <code>#N/A</code> when it does not find a match.  Here, you get a runtime error.  There are two solutions to this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the <code>Application.Match</code> version of the function instead of <code>Application.WorksheetFunction.Match</code>.  Unfortunately, Intellisense will not help you here, but it is a valid function.  It has the key difference that it will <strong>return</strong> an error instead of throwing a runtime error.  You can then check this error using <code>IsError</code> like your original idea.</li>
<li>Use an <code>On Error Goto XXX</code> to route the error to somewhere instead of the <code>If</code>.  You can generally assume that an error here means you did not find an entry, and then work around it that way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given these two choices, I strongly recommend you go with option 1.  That code would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>Sub Trim()
    Dim NeededColumns As Variant
    NeededColumns = Array(""APPLICATION NUMBER"", ""DATE"", ""BRAND"", ""CHANNEL"", ""SCHEME"")


    Range(""A1"").Select
    Do Until ActiveCell = """"
        If IsError(Application.Match(ActiveCell.Value, NeededColumns, 0)) Then

        Else
            ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Select
        End If
    Loop
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I have traded your <code>=0</code> condition for a check on <code>IsError(Application.Match(...))</code> this will return <code>True</code> if the column is not found.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>With empty cells in the places with no numbers. I tried searching through the forum but I wasn't able to find anything similiar enough.
I would really apreciate any help on this.  Thanks for your time.</p>
","<p>Here is an approach that works on a block of data of arbitrary size.  It works by sorting the columns and then shifting the cells down if they are not equal to the smallest value in the row.</p>

<p>The only real parameter here to adjust is the starting cell: <code>rng_start</code> which is initially set to the <code>ActiveCell</code>.  This code also uses <code>CurrentRegion</code> so the data needs to be a block... or you can redefine those couple of lines.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<pre><code>Sub SortAndPutSameValuesInSameRow()

    'get data ranges
    Dim rng_start As Range
    Set rng_start = ActiveCell

    Dim rng_data As Range
    Set rng_data = rng_start.CurrentRegion
    Set rng_data = Intersect(rng_data, rng_data.Offset(1))

    'sort by column
    Dim rng_col As Range
    For Each rng_col In rng_data.Columns
        rng_col.Sort Key1:=rng_col
    Next

    'iterate through rows and arrange
    Dim rng_row As Range
    For Each rng_row In rng_data.Rows
        Dim rng_cell As Range
        For Each rng_cell In rng_row.Cells
            If rng_cell.Value &lt;&gt; Application.WorksheetFunction.min(rng_row) Then
                rng_cell.Insert xlShiftDown
            End If
        Next

        'break out if cell goes past data
        If Intersect(rng_row, rng_start.CurrentRegion) Is Nothing Then
            Exit For
        End If
    Next
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<p>The main idea here is that once the columns are sorted, you just need to move values down so that only the smallest value is kept in each row. This logic also ensures that all of the same values are in the same row.  Note that if there are duplicate values, you will get a row of matching values and then duplicate values (which would also match if repeated in multiple columns).  Specific comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>The top half of the code is setting things up for the iteration section below.  It grabs the block of data and builds a range that excludes the headers.</li>
<li>With the block of data, it first goes through each column and sorts them in turn.</li>
<li>Once sorted, it goes through each row of the data and checks if the current value is equal to the minimum value in the row.</li>
<li>If so, then that cell can stay put.  If not, the values need to shift down to make a blank cell.</li>
<li>Finally, there is a check to bust out of the loop when needed.  This is a little odd in a <code>For Each</code> loop but is required because the size of the range is changing as it iterates (because of <code>Insert</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I am using <code>Rows</code> and <code>Columns</code>, this code will work for data anywhere on the sheet and for as many columns as you want.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Thank you</p>
","<p>A little late on the response, but here is how this is done.  The idea is that you need to create a class module which can handle the events for the <code>Label</code>.  Once you have the class in place to handle the event, you need to wire up the new/existing <code>Labels</code> to go through the class.  This is commonly done by creating a <code>Collection</code> which holds all your class objects.  Other than that, you just need to create a class object for each label (new or existing).  The following pieces are needed:</p>

<ul>
<li>UserForm1 with its code behind</li>
<li>LabelHolder class module</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LabelHolder</strong> class module contains the code for an ideal ""Label Holder"".  This is a simple class which holds a reference to a <code>MSForms.Label</code> and handles each one's events.  Note that I have called the object <code>Label1</code> so that I could lazily copy your code.  This <code>Label1</code> has <strong>nothing to do</strong> with the <code>Label1</code> on the <code>UserForm</code>; they have different scopes and are independent.</p>

<pre><code>'class module code
Public WithEvents Label1 As MSForms.Label
Private x_offset%, y_offset%

Private Sub Label1_MouseDown(ByVal Button As Integer, ByVal Shift As Integer, _
    ByVal X As Single, ByVal Y As Single)

    If Button = XlMouseButton.xlPrimaryButton Then
        x_offset = X
        y_offset = Y
    End If

End Sub

Private Sub Label1_MouseMove(ByVal Button As Integer, ByVal Shift As Integer, _
    ByVal X As Single, ByVal Y As Single)

    If Button = XlMouseButton.xlPrimaryButton Then
        Label1.Left = Label1.Left + X - x_offset
        Label1.Top = Label1.Top + Y - y_offset
    End If

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UserForm1 code behind</strong> shows the event for the button which creates a new <code>Label</code> and adds it to the <code>Collection</code>.  It also stores the <code>Collection</code> which ensures that the class objects have a global scope and are not garbage collected early.  There is also an <code>Initialize</code> event which shows how to add an existing <code>Label</code> to the fold.</p>

<pre><code>'UserForm1 code behind
Dim labels As Collection

Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

    If labels Is Nothing Then
        Set labels = New Collection
    End If

    Dim lbl As MSForms.Label
    Set lbl = Frame1.Controls.Add(""Forms.Label.1"")

    lbl.Caption = ""testing""

    Dim holder As New LabelHolder
    Set holder.Label1 = lbl

    labels.Add holder

End Sub

Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()

    If labels Is Nothing Then
        Set labels = New Collection
    End If

    Dim holder As New LabelHolder
    Set holder.Label1 = Label1

    labels.Add holder

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Finally here is an image of the <code>UserForm1</code> which has default names for all the controls.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/50IWt.png"" alt=""image of user form""></p>

<p>Same form after clicking the button and dragging things around:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a3rqM.png"" alt=""picture after some work""></p>

<p>All of this code shows how to connect a class module to dynamically created and original components on the User Form.  It does not address how to create a new <code>Label</code> with the drag/drop, but it is possible.  You would put that code in the class module and ensure that you have enough references back to the User Form in order to access the properties you need there.</p>

"<p>I am extracting text between parens in the active window title bar. That part is working great (thanks to some help I received here previously!). Now I want to create two separate macros - one that returns only the first name, and the other that returns only the last name. </p>

<p>My active window title bar looks something like this:</p>

<p>some text to the left (HENDERSON,TOM) some text to the right
(there is no space after the comma)</p>

<p>The last name macro works perfectly. It looks like this:</p>

    strPatientName = Mid(ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Caption, _
        OpenPosition + 1, closeposition - OpenPosition - 1)
    Dim c As Long
    c = InStr(strPatientName, "","")
    strPatientName = Left(strPatientName, c - 1)
    Selection.TypeText strPatientName
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The second macro is identical to the first, except that the second-to-last line of code has a ""Right"" instead of a ""Left"" instruction:</p>

<pre><code>Sub a1FirstName()
    'Extract first name of patient from title bar (between parens)
    Dim strPatientName As String
    Dim OpenPosition As Integer '(open paren marker)
    Dim closeposition As Integer '(close paren marker)
    OpenPosition = InStr(ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Caption, ""("")
    closeposition = InStr(ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Caption, "")"")
    strPatientName = Mid(ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Caption, _
        OpenPosition + 1, closeposition - OpenPosition - 1)

    c = InStr(strPatientName, "","")
    strPatientName = Right(strPatientName, c - 1)
    Selection.TypeText strPatientName

<p>The only examples I'm able to find anywhere in Google land are specifically for Excel. I have combined through my VBA manuals, and they all give similar examples as I have used for extracting the text to the right of a character.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
","<p>Seems like everyone has keyed in on <code>Split</code> to get the first/second part of the name.  You can also use <code>Split</code> to get rid of the parentheses.  This works if you know that you will only (and always) have a single <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong> gives the main idea.  You can use <code>Split</code> to get the part of the <code>String</code> which does not include the <code>(</code> or <code>)</code> and then do it again to get either side of the <code>,</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Sub t()

    Dim str As String
    str = ""(Wall,Byron)""

    Dim name_first As String
    Dim name_last As String

    'two splits total
    name_last = Split(Split(str, ""("")(1), "","")(0)
    name_first = Split(Split(str, "")"")(0), "","")(1)

    'three split option, same code to remove parentheses
    name_last = Split(Split(Split(str, ""("")(1), "")"")(0), "","")(0)
    name_first = Split(Split(Split(str, ""("")(1), "")"")(0), "","")(1)


End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The code above presents a <code>two Split</code> and a <code>three Split</code> option.  The main difference is that the three Split variety uses the same code to strip off the parentheses, and the only change is which side of the <code>,</code> to grab.  The two Split options take advantage of the fact that splitting on a comma removes one the parentheses for free.  The indices there are a little more complicated.</p>

","<p>This sort of copy can be done easily with <code>Copy</code>.  In order to pick the output <code>Range</code> for the paste part, you can use an <code>Application.InputBox</code> with a <code>Type:=8</code> parameter.  This prompts Excel to open the <code>Range</code> selection dialog which works well.</p>

<p>Once you know those two pieces, the only difficulty is building the <code>Ranges</code>.  This is not difficult, but <em>is</em> specific to the context, existing data on the sheets, and degree of robustness.  For the example below, I am using <code>CurrentRegion</code> to get the block of data (same as hitting <kbd>CTRL+A</kbd>) and then <code>Intersect</code> to only get the desired columns.  You can also make use of <code>UsedRange</code> and <code>End</code> to build ranges.</p>

<p><strong>Picture of ranges</strong> shows the different sheets for input and the final sheet for output.  The sheet to paste into <code>c</code> is empty for now.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o5MbZ.png"" alt=""data and empty sheet""></p>

<p><strong>Code</strong> does the work to get the two ranges to copy and then prompts for an output location.  From there, it pastes the resulting <code>Ranges</code> into the desired location.  There is an <code>Offset</code> to ensure that the 2nd range does not overlap the first.</p>

<pre><code>Sub CopyFromTwoRanges()

    Dim rng_set1 As Range
    Dim rng_set2 As Range

    Dim rng_output As Range

    'build the ranges
    Set rng_set1 = Intersect(Sheets(""a"").Range(""C:F""), _
        Sheets(""a"").Range(""C1"").CurrentRegion)

    Set rng_set2 = Intersect(Sheets(""b"").Range(""C:F""), _
        Sheets(""b"").Range(""C1"").CurrentRegion)

    'prompt for cell
    Set rng_output = Application.InputBox(""Pick the range"", Type:=8)

    'ensure a single cell only
    Set rng_output = rng_output.Cells(1, 1)

    'paste the ranges
    rng_set1.Copy rng_output
    rng_set2.Copy rng_output.Offset(, rng_set1.Columns.Count)

<p>But it was not helping. Need some guidance on how to solve this.</p>
","<p><strong>An approach without the error handling</strong></p>

<p>It is possible to build the <code>AutoFilter</code> in a way that does not throw the error if nothing is found.  The trick is to <strong>include the header row in the call to the <code>SpecialCells</code></strong>.  This will ensure that at least 1 row is visible even if nothing is found (Excel will not hide the header row).  This prevents the error from jamming up execution and gives you a set of cells to check if data was found.</p>

<p>To check if the resulting range has data, you need to check <code>Rows.Count &gt; 1 Or Areas.Count &gt; 1</code>.  This handles the two possible cases where your data is found directly under the header or in a discontinuous range below the header row.  Either result means that the <code>AutoFilter</code> found valid rows.</p>

<p>Once you check that data was found, you can then do the desired call to <code>SpecialCells</code> on the data only without concern for an error.</p>

<p><strong>Sample data [column C (field 2) will be filtered]:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iKHtN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iKHtN.png"" alt=""random data""></a></p>

<pre><code>Sub TestAutoFilter()

    'this is your block of data with headers
    Dim rngDataAndHeader As Range
    Set rngDataAndHeader = Range(""B2"").CurrentRegion

    'this will knock off the header row if you want data only
    Dim rngData As Range
    Set rngData = Intersect(rngDataAndHeader, rngDataAndHeader.Offset(1))

    'autofilter
    rngDataAndHeader.AutoFilter Field:=2, Criteria1:=64

    'get the visible cells INCLUDING the header row
    Dim rngVisible As Range
    Set rngVisible = rngDataAndHeader.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)

    'check if there are more than 1 rows or if there are multiple areas (discontinuous range)
    If rngVisible.Rows.Count &gt; 1 Or rngVisible.Areas.Count &gt; 1 Then
        Debug.Print ""found data""

        'data is available, this call cannot throw an error now
        Set rngVisible = rngData.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)

        'do your normal execution here

        '

<p><strong>Other notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Code includes a separate variable called <code>rngData</code> if you want access to data without headers.  This is just an INTERSECT-OFFSET to bump it one row down.</li>
<li>For the case where a result was found, code resets <code>rngVisible</code> to be the visible cells in the data only (skips header).  Since this call cannot fail now, it is safe without error handling.  This gives you a range that matches what you tried the first time but without the chance of getting an erorr.  This is not required if you can process the original range <code>rngVisible</code> that includes the headers.  If that is true, you can do away with <code>rngData</code> completely (unless you have some other need for it).</li>

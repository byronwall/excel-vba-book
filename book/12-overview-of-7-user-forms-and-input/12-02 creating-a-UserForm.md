## creating a UserForm

Creating a UserForm is a simple process: open the VBE and then right click to Insert -> UserForm. This will give you a default UserForm that is blank, has a default name, and is a default size. If you're lucky, this will also open the UserForm for editing and show you the toolbox which provides controls to edit. Once the form is created, there are a couple of things which you should do immediately, before you forget:

- Change the name of the form to something more useful than UserForm1
- Change the `Caption` on the form to something better than UserForm
- Consider changing the `ShowModal` property if you know you do not want a modal dialog

Once those items are done (or decided against) you can start adding controls to the USerForm and changing its size.

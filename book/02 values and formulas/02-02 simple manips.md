## simple manipulations (one steppers)

This section will focus on simple manipulations.  Simple manipulatiosn generally take a two step process: identiyf a `Rnage` to work with and then do something to that `Range`.  In a lot of cases, the `Range` contains multiple cells and may be iterated through a cell at a time to apply the action.

These simple manipulations truly are simple. It inluces things like:

* Change the value of a cell
* Change the value of a gorup of cells
* Change the formula of a cell
* Change the formatting of a cell
* Clear teh formatting or value from a cell
* Return some piece of infomation about a cell


TODO: deal with these later

Name a group of cells
Add a hyperlink to the current cell

TODO: add a couple examples of the simple manupiluations

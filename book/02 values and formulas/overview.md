# overview of 2 values and formulas

Values and formulas will focus on what to do with a Range after you have it.  This typically falls into a couple of categories:

* Do some control logic based on the value of the Cell
* Apply some formatting to the cell
* Modify the formulas of the cell
* Manipulate the cell or its neighbors in order to produce a more useful result
* Transform the cells based on their content

In addition to those basic tasks, also include:

* Working with Conditional Formatting

TODO: run through bUTL and see what other category of things there are

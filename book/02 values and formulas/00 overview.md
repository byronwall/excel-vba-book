# overview of 2 values and formulas

Values and formulas will focus on what to do with a Range after you have it.  This typically falls into a couple of categories:

* Do some control logic based on the value of the Cell
* Apply some formatting to the cell
* Modify the formulas of the cell
* Manipulate the cell or its neighbors in order to produce a more useful result
* Transform the cells based on their content
* Do something specific to Excel with the `Range`: conditional formatting, data validation, comment, hyperlink etc.
* adding or deleting a `Range` or possibly just using one of the clear function

In addition to those basic tasks, also include:

* Working with Conditional Formatting
* Combining some more advanced topics like using the data in a `Range` to manipulate something about a `Chart`

TODO: run through bUTL and see what other category of things there are

### Common reasons for using a UDF

There are a number of consistent spots where I will use a UDF instead of fighting the Excel formulas. Thee typically fall into a couple of categories:

Excel formulas can be quite complicated/repetitive if need to store a variable
Certain valuable pieces of information about the cell or a Range are not available via functions
Some things are just much easier to do with VBA than with Excel

### some simple techniques for finding a `Range`

The simple selection techniques consist of

* Use the ActiveCell -- `ActiveCell` (see later for why these are different)
* Use the selection -- `Selection`
* Hard-code the address of a single cell -- `Range("A1")` or `Cells(1,1)` (please don't use the latter)
* Name a cell and use that name directly -- `Range("CellName")`

These are considered simple, but their simplicity means they are commonly used.  These techniques can return a `Range` that represents either a single cell or multiple cells or a group of discontinuous cells.  The one exception to this is the `ActiveCell`; it is always a single cell.

#### Selection and ActiveCell

The `Selection` and `ActiveCell` commands both work based on what is currently going on with the active spreadsheet.  In particular, they work on the current selection of the `ActiveSheet` in the `ActiveWorkbook`.  For a normal workflow, the active sheet and workbook are the ones with focus (or that last had focus).  When working through an involved workflow, you can control the `ActiveSheet` and `ActiveWorkbook`.  In general, you should not use these commands in an involved workflow without a very good reason.

##### Selection

`Selection` is a catch all object that refers to anything that is selected.  If the current selection is a group of cells, then you get a `Range`.  If instead the selection is a Chart, Shape, button, or some other non-`Range`, then you will get an error if you assume that it has type `Range`.  When working with the `Selection`, it is always good to assign a new `Range` variable equal to the `Selection`.  This ensures that you get Intellisense for commands and also ensures that VBA will throw an error if the `Selection` is something other than a `Range`.

##### ActiveCell

### the kitchen sink of remaining `Range` ideas

* Pull the `Range` reference from some other object
* Name a cell and use that name indirectly -- `Names("CellName")`
* Ask the user to select the `Range` to use
* Use a function to get a reference -- `Application.Index`
* Search for the cell based on its function or value -- `Find()`
* Process a formula to determine the `Range` it depends on

### finding a `Range` while iterating through a `Range`

TODO: add content here

This technique hits on teh following:

* While iterating through cells, use some logic to identify if a `Range` is the one you want:
      * Check the `Value` of the cell
      * Check if the cell has some property (e.g. `HasFormula`, `HasArray`, etc.)
      * Check the `Style` of the cell

# overview of 5 shapes and images

It's possible that there is not really enough content to fill this chapter.  Need to think about it.  There is plenty of stuff to be done with shapes/images, but they are not the most common things to do in Excel. Typically there is a better tool for the job, but you might be forced to deal with this in Excel.

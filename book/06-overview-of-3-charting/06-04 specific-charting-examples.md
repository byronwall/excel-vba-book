This section will focus on some specific applications of applying VBA to charts. The code here can be quickly reused for your own application. These examples include:

- Creating a grid of XY scatter plots (a scatter matrix) based on a block of data
- Creating a panel of time series, one chart per each value with a common x-axis

TODO: identify the examples to include here

### common properties of the Chart

The Chart object is mostly a container for the other more useful properties of the Chart, but there are a couple of common properties that live at this top level. Those include:

- The HasXXX: HasTitle, HasLegend (TODO: any others?) - control the display of these things
- ChartType
- Delete
- Copy (TODO: this on ChartObject also?)

TODO: find more of these

In addition to those properties, the Chart object provides access to other useful things via the common accessors:

- SeriesCollection
- Axes
- Legend
- ChartTitle
- ChartArea
- PlotArea

TODO: is this list complete?

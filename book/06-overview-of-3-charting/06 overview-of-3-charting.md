# overview of 3 charting

Charting will be a major chapter in this book since it's the focus of a lot of what I do.  It also is a spot where a significant amount of time can be saved since the chart options are awful to mess with.

Some high level topics:

* Creating a chart
* Formatting a chart
* Manipulating the series on a chart
* Changing the layout of charts on a page (make grid code)
* Common patterns when working through charts (`ForEach` loops wherever possible)

## simple manipulations (one steppers)

This section will focus on simple manipulations. Simple manipulations generally take a two step process: identify a `Range` to work with and then do something to that `Range`. In a lot of cases, the `Range` contains multiple cells and may be iterated through a cell at a time to apply the action.

These simple manipulations truly are simple. It includes things like:

- Change the value of a cell
- Change the value of a group of cells
- Change the formula of a cell
- Change the formatting of a cell
- Clear the formatting or value from a cell
- Return some piece of information about a cell

TODO: deal with these later

Name a group of cells
Add a hyperlink to the current cell

TODO: add a couple examples of the simple manipulations

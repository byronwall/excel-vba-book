## slightly more complicated manipulations (the two steppers)

This section will on the so called "two steppers".  I call them that because these manipulations typically involve two commands after identifying a `Range`.  the first command is usually a logic or loop, and the second command is the actual work ot be done.  Two steppers are important because a large number of complicated tasks involve nesting and combining these two steps.

Some examples of two step  manipulations includes;

* Run through a list of cells, if the text is numeric, convert to a number
* Run through a list of cells, if the cell is blank, fill with the value from above
* Run through some cells, check if the row is odd or even, and color the row from one of two colors
* Run through one list of cells, apply the formatting to the same cell in a different column

TODO: find some better examples for these as well

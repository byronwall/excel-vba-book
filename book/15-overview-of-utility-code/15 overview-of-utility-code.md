# overview of utility code

This chapter might be a dumping ground for useful code that is worth being able to reference. Some things to include here:

- Code to work through the selection on a Chart
- The RangeEnd function to quick get the end of a Range
- Some string processing code?
- The code to work with split values
- Code to convert a 2D array of values to 1D
- GetOrCreateWorksheet which gives you a valid object regardless of what existed
- CreateNextSheet which increments a name as needed
- Creating a Chart based on the XValues, Values, and Name (and order).
- CopyResize command which is used to replicate Copy/PasteValues without using the Clipboard

### callbacks

ONe important point here is that all events are hanlded via callbacks.  That is, you will create a Sub with a specific name and a speciifc signature which VBA then uses when the event occurs.  This callback is important because it includes the information that you will need to discern what happened with the evnet.  Each type of event can include its own speciifc parmaeters and your code can respond to them accoridnhly.  This is important because if a cell was Changed, you will want different infomraiton than when a Worksheet was activated.  In general, VBA is good about providing you usefu lparmaeters so that your events can properly determine what took place.  Despite the good parmaeters, you will very likely need to include If/Then code to determine if your event needs further processing.

## common patterns

THere are a number of patterns that are very common with Events. These patterns typically exist to avoid causing a problem or to avoid extra work where possible. Most VBA is not performance critical, but it is possible for an event to be called hundreds of times for a given chucnk of code. Since this is true, you can start to have an immeidate impact on perofmrance if your event hanlding code includes a number of unnecessary steps. As a side note, this is a good reminder that when trying to speed up code, you will nearly always do better to add `Application.EnableEvents = False` before your performance critical code; this assumes that your VBA does not rely on events firign to function properly.

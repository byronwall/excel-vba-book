## doing actions on a UserForm

Section will focus on performing commands on a UserForm without leaving the UserForm.  This looks mostly like normal forms programming.

Programming on a UserForm is one area of VBA that is largely indepednet of Excel.  Yes, you are able ot access the Object Model from a form, but most of the programming on a form is simple related to the form. This is also the one area of VBA where if you have done it before in another language, your expereince will transfer nearly 1:1.  Forms programming is largely all about building a good UI that meets your needs.  You can do a lot with VBA in terms of events and other sorts of dyanmic programming, but most of the itme you just make the form and get on with the real work.

Some of the ocmmont things you will want ot od when programming on a form include:

* Creating event handlers
* Parsing and respoding to user input
* Populating data in teh UserForm from the Object Model
* Accessing Properties of controls to change or use

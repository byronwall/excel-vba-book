# overview of 8 external data and connections

this chapter may not be required
connecting to external data sources gets specific very quickly

some possible options to discuss:

* scraping websites and getting that info into Excel (built in features might be better here)
* connecting to simple database and running queries against them
* mention that a full blown .NET addin may be better suited to this task

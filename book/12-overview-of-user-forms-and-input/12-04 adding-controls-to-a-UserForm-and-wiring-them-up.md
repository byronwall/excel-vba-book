## adding controls to a UserForm and wiring them up

Once your UserForm is created and the defaults are changed, your next task is to do something useful with the form. To that end, you will quickly need to add controls to the form and then wire those forms to useful actions. Adding the controls to the form is a straight forward process: show the Toolbox and then drag the items onto the form. Once you have dragged out a button, text box, and possibly a ListBox, you can simply copy and paste the previous items and avoid the Toolbox all around. There are a handful of controls that are not in the Toolbox by default. My strong advice here is to not use those controls if you are deploying this addin. Inevitably, some user will not have the OCX file or whatever is required to make it work. Just pass. Having said that, you may need to add a Date picker or possibly a RefEdit which are not included here (TODO: is that true about RefEdit?).

Dragging a control onto the form is fairly easy compared to the actual task of making a control do something useful. Below is a quick primer on how the different controls work, which properties are important, and will give you a guide for accomplishing 90% of what can be done with forms.

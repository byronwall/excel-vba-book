I have a set of 100 part numbers in a particular sheet and want to eliminate the data corresponding to those 100 part numbers from my Master Part List sheet (which contains a huge list of parts). I don't know how to proceed for this?

The Advanced Filter will do this for you fairly easily. If you have a sheet with the part numbers listed, you can use that as the criteria range. Once filtered, simply delete the visible rows and remove the filter.

Once deleted, you can clear the filter to get back to normal.

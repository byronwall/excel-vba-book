### putting it all together

Having given a snapshot of the options for inputs and outputs, it's worth commenting generally on how they all fit together. Your goal should be to build a workflow that consists of steps that can all be described individually and possibly run on their own. Your task is then generating these individual steps and determining how to wire them together. The most common approach to building these workflows is that you start with some single task and then the scope expands as the analysis expands. You can build the ultimate workhorse of a workflow initially, or you can adapt your code to the task as the task comes into view. Depending on where you're starting and the definition at the start, you will determine how complicated to make things at the start.

It is very common to start with a single, straight-through workflow and then build it out into Modules as the work expands. IN this way, you are constantly reevaluating the inputs nad output sof your program to build the smaller blocks which need these definitions. In my experience, nearly all VBA workflows will take shape in this process eventually. It's quite rate to build a complicate workflow once and for all. Generally you start simple and end up with a full featured application at the end.

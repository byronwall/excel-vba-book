# The Workbook object

## introuction to the Workbook

This chapter will focus on the Workbook object. There are only a handful of things that are done at the Workbook levle, but those few items are quite important.  The main things to be done with a Workbook are:

* Create, open, close, and save Workbooks
* Manage references to Workbooks
* Change certain properties of the Workbook (TODO: are there any?)
* Access certain properties of the Workbook (e.g. Path)

This will be a quick chapter since the items below are fairly straight forward.  Having said that, this chapter will be quite relevant if you are working through a complex workflow tha tinvolves creating temporary or new Workbooks to store data or analysis.  Being able to create and work with Workbooks will give you the confidence to fire up a new Workbook for a one-off analysis instead of polluting the exisitng Workbook with a one-off Worksheet or other data dump.

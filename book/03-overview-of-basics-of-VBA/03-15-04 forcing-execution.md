### forcing execution

In addition to watching the execution of a program, you also have the ability to chagne the execution. T his si done by using the `Set next command` TODO: name? while running. This is the "nuclear" option of debugging because it does exactly what it says. It will tell VBA to execute _whatever_ line you want next. This allows you to completely ruin your execution while also providing you the power to step to a given spot. It's always the case when writing code that you end up on the wrong side of an If/Else while developing a loop. Sometimes, you just want to see what happens if you go down the other branch. T his option allows you to test that alternative execution path without having to modify your code. You just tell the debugger to execute that bracnh next and things will work. Very often howveer, you can using this feature to accidecanlly skip over code where variables are declared or Set and then you will have all sorts of errors because objects are set to `Nothing` instead of the values that are required.

Despite the pitfalls of moving execution arbitrarily, most people who know this feature exists are capable of using it appropriately. They typically are not surpised when things break.

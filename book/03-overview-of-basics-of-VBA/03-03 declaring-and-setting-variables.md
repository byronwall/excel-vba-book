## declaring and setting variables

One of the core tasks when programming via VBA is working with variables. Variables encompass a couple of different topics which makes sense since they are one of two core areas of VBA alongside control structures. That is, your programming exists of two possible categories: variables and control structures. Variables are made of the variables that you will need to declare and set to make your program work while also including all of the various aspects of the Excel object model. The object model is made of a significant number of variables (e.g. cell value for each cell) and a handful of Subs and Functions. The variables that you declare and use will look very similar to the object that the Excel model is using. There are also a large number of variables that you will create which exist to guide your own control structure or to encompass the algorithms that you need to execute.

To fully work with variables, it helps to split the topic into two areas: declaring variables and setting variables. These two topics are quite simple when it comes time to type out the commands, but variable declaration and setting is at the core of planning how a program will work. The variable declaration will directly shape how the control structures will work. The two go hand in hand and are equally important.

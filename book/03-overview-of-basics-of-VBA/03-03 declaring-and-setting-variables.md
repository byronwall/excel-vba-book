## Declaring and Setting Variables

One of the core tasks when programming via VBA is working with variables. Variables are used to reference the Excel object model and to guide control structures. Within the Excel object model, the objects hold variables which point to other objects. Working with these objects is critical to using VBA. You will need to understand variables to do that.

This section is split into two areas: declaring variables and setting variables. The code for these two topics is simple. The complexity comes in planning out the best structure for managing variables. The variable declaration will directly shape how the control structures will work.

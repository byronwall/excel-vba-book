### declaring an Optional parameter

The one additiojnal thign to consider is that of `Optional` parameters.  An optional parameter is one who is not strictly requried.  In liue of a value, you can either leave the parmaete rmissing or provide a default value.  In iether case, you can use the VBA specific function `IsMissing()` to determine if the aprmaeter was entered.  An Optiojnal parameter can be a very nice fearture when you are trying to determine whether or not to make a Sub take parameters or just use defaults.  You can provide the defaults in the parmaeter declaaration adn then allow the user (person typing the VBA) to override them if needed. This is a very common approach when writing library type code; provide snesible defualts that can be overwritten.

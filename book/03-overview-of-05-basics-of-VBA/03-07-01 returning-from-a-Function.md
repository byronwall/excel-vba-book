### returning from a Function

If you want to take advantage of a Function, you need to return a value from your Function.  This returned value can then be consumed by the caller (or not).  To return a value from a Function, you simply use the Function name as a variable and set its value appropriate.  If the return type is an object or reference type, then you need to use Set to return the object.  If it is a value type instead, you can simply set the return with an equal statement like any other value type.  Once you have made the return statement, you can call Exit Function to break out of the Function.

For the caller, there are two things to keep in mind when using Functions.  The first is that you must call the Function with parentheses in order to access the return value.  The corollary of this is that if you call a Function with parentheses, you must use that return value to set the value of a variable.  You will get an error if you do not do this correctly.  Note that if you do not want the return value for some reason, you can avoid using parentheses in the same way you call a Sub.  The second part is that you must call Set if the variable is an object/reference and not a value.

### forcing execution

In addition to watching the executiojn fo a programm, you also ahve the ability to chagne the execution. T his si done by usign the `Set next command` TODO: name? while running. This is the "nuclear" option of debugging becasue it does exaclty what it says. It will tell VBA to execute _whatever_ line you want next. This allows you to completely ruin your execution while also providing you the power to step to a given spot. It's always the case when writing code that you end up on the wrong side of an If/Else while developing a loop. Sometimes, you just want to see what happens if you go down teh other branch. T his option allows you to test that alternative execution path without having to modify your code. You just tell the debugger to execute that bracnh next and things will work. Very often howveer, you can using this feature to accidetanlly skip over code where variables are decalred or Set and then you will ahve all sorts of errors because objects are set to `Nothing` instead of the values that are required.

Despite the pitfalls of moving executiojn arbitrarily, most people who know this feature exists are capable of using it appropraitely. They typically are not surpised when things break.

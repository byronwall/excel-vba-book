# overview of 0.5 basics of VBA

section on VBA topics should include:

* basics of variables
    * common variable types
    * difference between value and reference types
* basics of control structure
    * if
    * select case
    * for loop
    * foreach loop
    * do/while loops
    * goto
* error handling
* Subs and Functions

most of this section is going to be boilerplate explanation of these things

consider how to improve on that to avoid saying the same stuff as everyone else (or just power through it to get it on paper)

later on, there should be an advanced VBA section to handle:

* classes
* events
* adding references to other objects (specifically Office and Microsoft Runtime)

The pitfalls of running macros and how they destroy the undo functionality.

* using the debugger
* using the Immediate window

## debugging your VBA code

One of the most useful features of VBA and the VBE is the ability to debug your code simply and in place. It is easy to take for granted the power of the VBE debugger, but it is worth mentioning that it is a solid debugger. The debugger has a handful of specific uses related to debugging your code:

- Stepping through excecution and watching the movement of values into and out of variables
- Using the Immediate Window to execute arbitrary code or output the results of some value
- Setting teh next instruction to force VBA to jump to an arbitrary point in your code
- Viewing teh call stack ot see how you reached a given spot
- Breaknig at an arbitrary breakpoint or after an error was thrown

### strategy #2, work through one `Range` and apply to another `Range`

This strategy comes up frequently when working through `Ranges` that are related somehow. The general idea is that you want to apply an action in one `Range` based on something about another `Range`. The simplest case of this is to move a value from `Range` to another. This simple case sometimes reduces to not much more than copying and pasting. Having said that, once you get past the simplest version of it, you will be doing something that copy and paste cannot handle.

TODO: add a couple examples of this

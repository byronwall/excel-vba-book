### strategy #1, do something if

This strategy really is the core of all advanced VBA development. It's simple enough: "do something, if". The endless possibilities come from the choices for "do something" and the things that could be checked in the "if". There are a handful of common scenarios that are best covered by storing some utility code (e.g. convert to a number if numeric). Most of these two step solutions though are specific to the task at hand.

In this section, the goal is to show the general form of this strategy with a couple of examples.

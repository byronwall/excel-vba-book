# overview of values and formulas

Values and formulas will focus on what to do with a Range after you have it. This typically falls into a couple of categories:

- Do some control logic based on the value of the Cell
- Apply some formatting to the cell
- Modify the formulas of the cell
- Manipulate the cell or its neighbors in order to produce a more useful result
- Transform the cells based on their content
- Do something specific to Excel with the `Range`: conditional formatting, data validation, comment, hyperlink etc.
- adding or deleting a `Range` or possibly just using one of the clear function

In addition to those basic tasks, also include:

- Working with Conditional Formatting
- Combining some more advanced topics like using the data in a `Range` to manipulate something about a `Chart`

TODO: run through bUTL and see what other category of things there are

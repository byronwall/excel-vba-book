# overview of 7 user forms and input

Some sections to include here:

* using the Application.InputBox to get different types of input (especially Ranges)
* creating a UserForm and wiring up events
* interacting with the spreadsheet from a UserForm
* a quick summary of the different pieces, when they're useful and specific/common properties

at the end of the day, there is not much too special about forms other than knowing what the different pieces are
this should be a relatively quick chapter since most of the referene material is elsewhere

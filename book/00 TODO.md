# TODO

* section or cheat sheet with the correspondence of keyboard shortcuts and VBA commands.
* create an actual TaskList program for this book to avoid tracking things here
* start to identify which bUTL code samples will be useful in which sections.
  * move those files to their chapters so that the code starts to show up in the book

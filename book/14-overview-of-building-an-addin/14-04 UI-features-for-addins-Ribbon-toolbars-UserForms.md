## UI features for addins, Ribbon, toolbars, UserForms

There are a number of UIs that can be provided for an addin. The most common involve using the Ribbon or providing UserForms (typically accessible from a keyboard shortcut). Those two approaches will discussed in detail. It is also worth mentioning that if you are going to support Excel 2007 and before, that the Ribbon did not exist back then. For those prior versions of Excel, the interfaces were built using toolbars and menu items. That's before my day, so I'll just say that if you use that code today, it will show up in the Ribbon. If you need to support those versions of Excel, you would do well to find a different book.

### Application

There are also a couple of events taht exist at the Application level. These include:

- OnWait
- TODO: any others?

Application.OnWait can be used to trigger an event at some point in the future. This can then be used to trigger a block of code which runs at an interval by having the triggered code start a new event in the future. In this ways, you can use VBA to start a timer which executes every so often.

TODO: add the OnWait code for a timer

TODO: find another examples

# overview of 10 building an addin

The addin chapter can be a real differentiator.  Making an addin is a great way to bring together a large number of related features that would be a pain to keep together anyways.

Some topics to hit:

* The advantages of always having an addin available to save new code into
* How to actually create an addin (the actual steps of saving it)
* Working with the Ribbon
* Adding keyboard shortcuts to the addin (via events)
* Managing the source code for an addin?

In addition to the VBA addin, it would be good to discuss the other options for extend Excel.

Include a section about Excel DNA and creating more powerful addins over there?

## introduction to the Application

This chapter will focus on the Application object. There are a number of significant details of Excel and its interaction with VBA that are controlled form the Application. In particular, the Application is responsible for providing access to calculation related properties and user display preferences.

The major features of the Application object include:

- Controlling the calculation
- Controlling events and other visual effects

### common properties of the Chart

The Chart object is mostly a container for the other more useful properties of the Chart, but there are a couple of common properties that live at this top level.  Those include:

* The HasXXX: HasTitle, HasLegend (TODO: any others?) - control the display of these things
* ChartType
* Delete
* Copy (TODO: this on ChartObject also?)

TODO: find more of these

In addition to those properties, the Chart object provides access to other useful things via the common accessors:

* SeriesCollection
* Axes
* Legend
* ChartTitle
* ChartArea
* PlotArea

TODO: is this list complete?

There are other ways to create an addin but using VBA is simple because it can be done entirely from Excel and the Visual Basic Editor. The main distinction between an addin and other VBA code is that an addin is meant to be available to all open Workbooks without having to put the code inside a Workbook. This can be a very nice thing to have if you are regularly do the same or similar operations across different Workbooks. The alternative to an addin is often to maintain a library of code that you regularly export/import into macro enabled files as needed. This can create a mess as you change code in one file but not in another. The alternative also typically requires you to put the code inside a the Workbook and make it macro enabled. For certain applications, this is a non-starter. The one other alternative to a true addin is to create a Workbook that contains the code you want, and then you can open that file and execute the code in the context of whatever other files are open. This works, and creating an addin can be viewed as the logical conclusion of this approach.

Sometimes it's tempting to add code to an existing addin that make sense only in the context of a single file. This works well if you and everyone else have the addin.

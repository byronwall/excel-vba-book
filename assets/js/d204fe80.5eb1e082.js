To "disable" the calculations, is really to set the CalculationMode to Manual. It does not actually disable calculations, but instead it prevents the automatic calculations updates from firing like normal. The spreadsheet still maintains its normal model of calculations; they just don\'t run. This is an incredibly common approach to speeding up the performance of VBA code. The performance boost results form the fact that when VBA code executes, it is very tightly coupled to the normal Excel operations that take place. When you use VBA to set a ',(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},".Value")," equal to some new value, it is functionally equivlabet to manually entering the value. Behind the scenes, Excel will fire off the normal Change events and update the dependent cells. This can become a bottleneck because VBA is able to rapidly fire off ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},".Value")," changes.

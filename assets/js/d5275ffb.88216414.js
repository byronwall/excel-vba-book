This distinction is meaningful because it helps you think about how much of your workflow is the automation of otherwise human tasks (which could still be done by a human) vs. steps that are purely programmatic and could not be replicated by a human. Where this distinction is most likely to show up is when you are deciding where and how to perform a calculations. In theory, all of the Excel spreadsheet could be done in VBA via the ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"WorksheetFunction")," object. Doing everything in VBA defeats a large part of the benefit that comes from programming with VBA.

The math was fine and the results were generally useful. The problem was that there was no way to spot check a given result without debugging code.

Where VBA comes in handy, is wiring together all of these items into a coherent package that runs more efficiently than anything that a human alone could do. The best workflows typically take a very simply underlying spreadsheet and apply to a large number of items. In this way, you are able to spot check a single result, verify the formulas, and investigate an interesting result. You are also free to just hit go and have 10,000+ realists streamed into a table for consumption. IF you find yourself looking for all sorts of tricks to avoid using the underlying Excel model for your programming, I'd strongly encourage to just switch to a fully programmatic language that does not have the Excel UI. You will save yourself a ton of headache. If you are only aware of VBA and looking to push the envelope in terms of performance, then that's an OK place to be.

Depending on what you are doing, some of these aspects may just exist on/within the spreadsheet and be easy to overlook as an input or output.

Well Excel provides you with a rich Object Model full of metadata about all of the various cells of data. That metadata can be as useful as actually structured data if there is a structure to it. I've seen it countless times where someone has methodically bolded all of the cells of intereste in a block of data. That bold format is as good as some field called ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Important = True")," which could then be processed in another language.

In a lot of other languages you have to spend a ton of time pointing the program to the correct file, or rows, or columns, or other items to process. In Excel, you leverage the fact that most people know how to select or activate items they want, and you can use that user input as an actual input to your VBA. This becomes quite powerful when you are building utility code that may be used across multiple workbooks.

When working with helper code, you will spend more time asking for user input, and handling the different cases that might come up."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Another key point to make is that the type of work that is being done in a chart can vary as well. The splitting line here is whether the Chart creation is data heavy or formatting heavy (or possibly both). For a data heavy Chart, you will spend a lot of time collecting Ranges, creating Series, and possibly manipulating individual Points. For a formatting heavy chart, you will spend a lot of time iterating through the Series to apply formatting, label the Axes, set the number formats, and generally modify the Excel defaults. Both of these tasks are very time intensive if you are doing them without VBA, so both lend themselves to being automated if possible."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Excel provides two means of creating a Chart depending on how you want to handle things.

Even better, this general framework lends itself nicely to adding new commands where needed.

These can be called from the inside of a loop to create a chain of commands to process a Chart. This approach is highly effective if you work in an environment where the same or similar things need to be done. For example: you have a monthly report to create each month for multiple departments. Standardizing as much of that work into modules makes it easy to apply the code in multiple spots with minor changes.

To be clear, your Form will do nothing without events. You could it to display static content from the designer mode, but it will do nothing useful.

Event Handlers are the glue (or wires) that take the actions performed on Controls and direct them somewhere useful. Events control everything from Clicking, Loading, Typing and everything else.

The reason for this is that you may want to perform the same action from multiple events. Putting the code in a handler makes it difficult to reuse the code because some ehadnlers have parameters nad other details that make it hard to arbitrary call them.

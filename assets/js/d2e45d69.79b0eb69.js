Beware that naming a variable has certain conventions, but these do not have any effect on the program execution.

When declaring a variable, you decide if the type should be the generic ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Variant")," or if you need a more specific type. There are times when you have to use Variant, but you should aim to use the most specific type that is possible.

This is generally always the case (why else would you create the variable). To that end, there are a pair of ways to use variables depending on whether it is a reference or value type. Value types are easier since you can only do 1 thing with them: use them in an expression. This feels and usually looks like mathematical formulas. The more complicated example comes with reference types where the variable stores a reference to another object. These variables have the ability to access either a property of the type or the default ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Value")," of the type. The distinctions between reference and value types can become confusing with the Excel Object Model since so many properties of objects reduce to value types. An example is the value of a ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Range")," which will hold some number or string or Error depending on what the cell contains."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"When accessing a property of the object, you use the ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},".")," to access a property by name. In this way, you can chain together a series of commands accessing the properties of objects. It is often the case that the property is itself another object which makes it possible to use another ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},".")," to keep going. If you are using the VBE and properly declaring your variables, the VBE will work to provide helpful suggestions of what may be possible to use next (this is called Intellisense). The one pitfall to Intellisense is when the return from a given property can be Variant or a combination of possible results. When this happens, Intellisense will not offer any suggestions and you are left guessing whether or not the command exists.

If I only need the variable once or am copying code from somewhere else (and know it works), I will just go with the code as is without Intellisense. The one upside of creating new variables is that it forces you to be more explicit with your declarations. It also clearly shows your intent to other developers that may see your code later."),(0,o.kt)("h3",{id:"value-default"},"Value Default"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I mentioned it above, but it is worth digging into the default ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Value")," property a little more. This can be a source of confusion because very often, you will accidentally use the name of a variable without calling for a property. In other programming languages, this will result in a compile time or runtime error. In VBA, your code will run and even worse will return something from the object that may not be what you want. When this happens, it can be incredibly difficult to track down the source of the error. To avoid this, you could never use the variable name as a shortcut to the ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},".Value")," property. In practice this is a pain to manage and I will often mix and match whether or not Value is called. Sometimes, I am tired of typing out Value and just let the default work. Other times, I am being very diligent about calling everything explicitly to avoid some unforeseen error later. You will find that this comes down to your own preference and the preferences of others working on your code."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

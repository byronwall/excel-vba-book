The most common involve using the Ribbon or providing UserForms (typically accessible from a keyboard shortcut). Those two approaches will discussed in detail. It is also worth mentioning that if you are going to support Excel 2007 and before, that the Ribbon did not exist back then. For those prior versions of Excel, the interfaces were built using toolbars and menu items. That's before my day, so I'll just say that if you use that code today, it will show up in the Ribbon.

For a given addin it may make sense to simply put the buttons and other access on an existing tab (Developer and Data are popular!) and provide that level of access. For an addin that has a dedicated purposed independent of other Excel features, it starts to make sense to add your own tab exclusively for your addin. This is good for helping your users find your features. It can also be more consistent in terms of keyboard shortcuts. If you are going to modify an existing tab, be abolustley certain that you verify that the keyboard shortcuts work as expected. There is nothing worse than having an addin break the ALT+A+R+Y shortcut which is supposed to reapply an autofilter. It is not fun when that shortcut becomes ALT+A+R+Y2. Seriously?"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"For the second point, you will need to consider the average user and their expectations. Keep in mind that the default Excel Ribbon includes a number of locations where user input is collected nad used beyond a simple button. This includes things like some number input (font size, page layout) and other drop downs. There is a willingness for Excel users to ues these features where it make sense. For what it's worth, from the Excel VBA point of view, it is much simpler to not try nad collect user input. This can be done (TODO: add examples), but the effort here is typically not worth the user experience. If you choose to go this route, I would highly recommend using drop downs and other inputs that provide some automatic filtering of user input. Trying to validate user input off the Ribbon is a pain and does not provide a good experience. Having said that, if you are designing for power users, you can build a very slick interface in the Ribbon that is unmatched."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The final point gets down to the nitty gritty of actually editing the Ribbon. The problem is that the Ribbon is defined in a file inside your XLAM file and is not editable from any part of the VBE or Exce interface. This means that it is a real pain to edit the Ribbon definition in the same way that you can edit the other VBA code. I have typically taken the approach of using a button on the Ribbon to launch a form that exists in VBA. That form can then be edited without having to touch the Ribbon definiont. This sounds tribial, but it can make a huge difference if you are designing an addin that has a lot of possible interactivity; it is very difficult to edit the Ribbon in real time. Having said that, there is one addin that makes this process much more manageable. It is from Andy Pope (TODO: add link) and works great for building out the interface. Even using that addin, it is a pian to add the callback necessary to tie the Ribbon to VBA.

This is often good for certain workflows where you do not want the user to change the underlying spreadsheet while you collect their input. There are other instances however where it makes sense to allow the user to change the active Workbook, Worksheet, or Selection and then interact with you rform. To allow for this behavior, set ',(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"ShowModal = False"),". THs will allow your form to exit even when the user clicks off and interacts with the spreadsheet again. This is a real game changer when you are working with code that operates on the current selection. You are then able to leave your form up while the user changes the selection.
